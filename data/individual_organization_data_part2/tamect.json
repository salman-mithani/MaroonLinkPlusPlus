In 1980, TAMECT acquired its first ambulance and was the first source of Advanced Life Support in College Station.&nbsp; In the early 1990&rsquo;s due to insurance liability, TAMECT was split into two entities. Emergency Care Team kept its student organization status, and <a title=\"TAMU EMS\" href=\"http://ems.tamu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Texas A&amp;M Emergency Medical Services</a>&nbsp;was formed under Student Health Services which handled the ambulance operations. Since then, TAMECT and TAMU EMS have kept close relationships and both operate out of the A.P. Beutel Health Center.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">At present, Texas A&amp;M Emergency Care Team members provide medical assistance to&nbsp;Standby EMTs as they staff first aid stations at most major University events including football games, various athletic events, Corps FTXs, March to the Brazos, Greek events, and&nbsp;the Rec Sports Facilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"http://tamect.tamu.edu/sites/default/files/large_1_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"http://tamect.tamu.edu/sites/default/files/large_2_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"http://tamect.tamu.edu/sites/default/files/large_3_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\" style=\"text-align: left;\">We also provide a large number of training opportunities for our members including First Aid, CPR, Advanced First Aid, and other miscellaneous educational opportunities. &nbsp;We are an all-volunteer student organization committed to providing the best quality emergency medical care to the students, faculty, and friends of Texas A&amp;M.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\"><strong>Recognitions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">Texas A&amp;M Emergency Care Team has shown its desire to help both friends and strangers even in times of crisis. TAMECT members were the first medical personnel on scene at the tragic Aggie Bonfire Collapse of 1999. The members already stationed at the bonfire construction site called in the emergency. While the team on scene began providing aid, other members rushed to the scene afterhearing news of the accident. TAMECT also helped provide medical care after Hurricanes Ike and Rita. Hurricane victims finding refuge in College Station were greeted by Emergency Care Team members as they unloaded people from planes who needed medical attention.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\">Organization members have further shown their knowledge of medical skills at the National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation annual conference.
