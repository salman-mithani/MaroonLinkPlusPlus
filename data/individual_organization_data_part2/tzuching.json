We dedicate ourselves to four missions: Charity, Medicine, Education, and Humanistic Culture. <br /> <br /> The TCCA (Tzu Chi Collegiate Association) is the collegiate branch of Tzu Chi. Here at the collegiate level, we focus our efforts on charity, volunteer work, and community service, while growing and bonding together as a family. However, our activities are not only done through the efforts of the collegiate students; we work closely with the adult, alumni, and high school volunteers. We participate in other causes too, such as disaster relief and even bone marrow transplant!<br /> <br /> We are one big Tzu Chi family and we work together in order to achieve a common goal. College Station is only one of many regions throughout not only the United States, but the world.</span></p>","summary":"Howdy! \r\nWe are Texas A&M University's Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (TCCA), a humanitarian organization dedicated to making the world a better place.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1355829,"discussionId":1355829,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/organization/tzuching","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/tamutzuchi/","TwitterUrl":"","TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":null,"organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"89a10504-f113-4829-90c8-a5b701219b14","firstName":"Lilian","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Kao","primaryEmailAddress":"kaolilian@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":171371,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":94173,"phoneNumber":null,"state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
