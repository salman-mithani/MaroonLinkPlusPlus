We are the oldest continuing Asian American sorority in the nation, as well as the third oldest Asian American sorority founded. Since 1949, Sigma Phi Omega Sorority, Inc. has expanded across the United States, holding multiple chapters in California and Texas. Our vision as a sorority is to promote sisterhood. We hold many sisterhood events throughout the year to promote such values as: unity, friendship and teamwork. Our mission is to help young women adjust to college life by creating a sisterhood that promotes Asian awareness. The sisters of Sigma Phi Omega are strongly committed to serving the community, as well. Our official National Philanthropy is domestic violence. In honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, our organization hosts a week of anti-domestic violence activities. However, this does not limit us to just one cause, our mission is much wider with a variety of other community service projects. Sigma Phi Omega Sorority, Inc. intends to uphold it's foundation, while infusing it with the Aggie Spirit.</p>","summary":"Sigma Phi Omega was originally founded in 1949 at the University of Southern California by a group of Japanese women in response to growing anti-Asian-American sentiment that followed as a result of World War II and Pearl Harbor.
