SBSLC was formed as a yearly forum where African-American students from across the country could assemble to engage in meaningful personal and professional development while addressing the problems and concerns that affected the Black community. Now in its 27th year of existence, SBSLC carries on that legacy and unites nearly 1,000 student participants, advisors, workshop presenters, nationally renowned speakers, and a variety of corporations and graduate institutions each January for four truly impactful days of conference activities. <br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: small;\">SBSLC's Mission: <span style=\"color: #000000;\">The importance of combining knowledge with family, religion, culture, and community to be used as tools to become productive members of society is our mission as &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s Black Leaders: Our Hope for Tomorrow.&rdquo; As members of the African American Community, we must use our strength and pride to take the initiative to educate our youth and to help them to focus on their futures. It is not for us to wait until tomorrow to rescue our young people from the dangers surrounding us; the time is now. The conference encompasses history, leadership and networking skills, and self-improvement techniques. In addition, the conference values clarification and uses corporate America to inspire and motivate the intellect of young Black collegians to be productive leaders of tomorrow. </span></span></p>","summary":"The importance of combining knowledge with family, religion, culture, and community to be used as tools to become productive members of society is our mission as “Today’s Black Leaders: Our Hope for Tomorrow.”","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1302770,"discussionId":1302770,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2760,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"http://sbslc.tamu.edu","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/sbslc","TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":"SbslcTamu"},"profilePicture":"100fb0e5-1cf5-4412-9c3f-de44e63ceea20fbb37db-1b5a-44e2-ad96-d53fff29a2fe.jpg","organizationType":{"id":2760,"name":"Sponsored - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"d89e6cb0-d624-4d90-a093-a4ff0124005b","firstName":"Alize","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Staver","primaryEmailAddress":"astaver@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":"ab5aca7d-72fe-48f6-8895-d250a76941da4102e3fa-4363-428a-8476-875625e02cf8.JPG","institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":166768,"addressType":0,"city":"College Station","country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":"979-862-2640","organizationId":89391,"phoneNumber":"979-845-4565","state":"TX","street1":"Memorial Student Center","street2":"Suite 2200","zip":"77845"}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
