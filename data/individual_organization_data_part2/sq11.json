This allows upperclassmen and peers to mentor each other in their studies. We also connect cadets with leading companies and professionals in their field of study and assist them in preparing for life after college. Our cadets recognize their superiors, peers, and subordinates and maintain professional relationships based off of mutual respect. We work to make each other successful and have a tight family-like culture. We also have a demanding training regiment, based on competition that pushes us physically and mentally. Heaven&rsquo;s 11 gives a well-rounded leadership experience that develops cadets into successful leaders of character.</p>","summary":"Heaven's 11 is a STEM Air Force outfit in the Corps of Cadets.
