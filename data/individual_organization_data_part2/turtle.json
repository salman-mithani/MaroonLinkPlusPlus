The goal was simply to form a group of motivated students who could work on interesting projects throughout the semester. However, the club soon gained support from other students of various engineering majors who also wished for an opportunity to apply their skills and knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>Today, TURTLE has grown to more than 40 members with several active projects, and it continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only student organization at Texas A&amp;M University that is specifically geared towards the field of robotics. We hope that the organization will continue to grow and become&nbsp;a premier robotics club for the university. Now, the official faculty advisor is <a href=\"http://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/people/hur-pilwon\" target=\"_blank\"> Dr. Pilwon Hur</a>, and many other faculty&nbsp;serve as our unofficial&nbsp;secondary advisers.</p>\r\n<p>TURTLE's main goal is to provide an opportunity for students to develop and showcase their novel ideas and problem-solving skills. In addition, emphasis&nbsp;is placed on team-work and leadership skills. Successful members of this organization learn to work with&nbsp;teammates from&nbsp;various disciplines&nbsp;to bring their assigned projects to completion. This includes&nbsp;building and testing final designs.</p>\r\n<p>Others goals of TURTLE include&nbsp;reaching out to high&nbsp;school students in special events and participating&nbsp;in robotics&nbsp;competitions whenever possible. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>TURTLE accepts undergraduate and graduate students of all engineering majors.&nbsp;Students in other areas of study who are interested in the organization are&nbsp;also encouraged to inquire about possible positions.&nbsp;For more specific information about our organization, click the tabs above, visit&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://studentactivities.tamu.edu/app/organization/profile/public/id/1392\">student activities profile,</a> or contact us directly.</p>","summary":"The Texas A&M University Robotics Team and Leadership Experience (TURTLE) is an independent robotics club at Texas A&M which gives engineering students the opportunity to work on fun projects every semester.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1303273,"discussionId":1303273,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRbIS8kOQop3mQsLgYvta8Q","FacebookUrl":"http://facebook.com/turtlerobotics","TwitterUrl":"","TwitterUserName":"turtle_robotics"},"profilePicture":"5b9ce06b-a66e-49eb-b33f-3a599f2be390be41441b-6126-4573-9866-f839230ad12a.jpg","organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"7dd7e635-cd7e-4cfb-9cf9-a5ea01296444","firstName":"Joshua","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Vancura","primaryEmailAddress":"jvan1997@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":166937,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":89568,"phoneNumber":null,"state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
