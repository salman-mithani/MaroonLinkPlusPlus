After finally acquiring the financial help he needed from the University, he and a few other founding members drove across the country to purchase our first boat, an old wooden Pocock. Because of the difficulties associated with starting a team, the crew did not race their first year. The following year, the team made its debut at the 2002 Head of the Colorado regatta in Austin, TX. It is there that they took the gold in the Mixed 8.</p>\r\n<p>Come out to one of our regattas and support Texas A&amp;M Crew!</p>","summary":"The best way to get updates, pictures, and schedules about the Texas A&M Rowing Team will be through our website www.tamucrew.com! \r\n","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1302604,"discussionId":1302604,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2752,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"http://www.tamucrew.com","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Texas-AM-Crew/203221106364305?fref=ts&ref=br_tf","TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":"b996408f-a170-4dd6-a26d-c1f0ac6ca3a5e395790e-97a8-4e1f-a3fd-b8c1e017f6e5.jpg","organizationType":{"id":2752,"name":"Affiliated - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"5cb78eba-cd0b-4150-9c35-a5100169cb8b","firstName":"Sandra","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Dalbello","primaryEmailAddress":"sdalbello@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":166602,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":89225,"phoneNumber":null,"state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
