In order to fulfill our mission, we partner with local non-government community organizations and provide them the method and tools they need in order to secure access to clean water. The communities we help are often in remote areas with little or no access to clean drinking water. The local organizations continue to monitor and repeat additional projects in the area throughout the year with the ongoing support of J4W. This ensures that more people will be helped and that each project is successful and sustainable for years to come.</p>","summary":"Just4Water fights global water scarcity by providing sustainable solutions to communities in need.
