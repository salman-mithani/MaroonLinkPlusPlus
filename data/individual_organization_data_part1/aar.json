AAR was created in 1996, and our main goals include educating the Bryan/College Station community about responsible pet care, supporting local animal rescue efforts through volunteering and fundraising, and providing TAMU students with the opportunity to participate in different social events and community service. We achieve these goals by giving presentations at local elementary schools among other community wide events. We hold general organizational meetings every two weeks at which we have speakers from local rescue organizations, or animal-related groups, present. This organization can grow and succeed with support and membership if we can make a difference for at least one animal, it would be well worth the effort.","summary":"Aggies for Animal Rescue (AAR) is a recognized student organization made up of students, faculty, and staff from all departments on campus that love animals and have a desire to make a difference.
