During the retreat freshmen can expect to experience a mixture of planned leadership activities and the freedom to meet new people and make worthwhile connections.</p>\r\n<p>The first day consists of transportation to the location of the retreat, Messiah&rsquo;s Ranch, and the first of our two keynote speakers. We depart from Hullabaloo Hall at 5:30 PM and head to Messiah's Ranch. This is a good day to get acclimated with the location and grow comfortable with each other and the staff.</p>\r\n<p>The second day is full of planned activities. During this day we have a group of student leaders visit Messiah&rsquo;s to talk with the freshmen about their organizations, our last keynote speaker, and a workshop rotation to help better develop their leadership skills. The day is capped off by a mixer.</p>\r\n<p>The third day is wrapped up at noon to send the freshmen back to campus. On this day the freshmen will put together one last skit to pretend to sell a product. Shirts are passed out, and after pictures are taken we will all head home.</p>\r\n<p>\"Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no path &amp; leave a trail\" -Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>","summary":"The retreat is coming up soon! Remember to meet at Hullabaloo at 4:30 on Friday January 26th.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1302348,"discussionId":1302348,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2752,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"http://fldr.tamu.edu","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":null,"TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":"4e44f855-c65f-46dc-bc6e-f0fdcfd9d6fcb0d5a743-c682-4a77-8953-2f8f204d5f95.jpg","organizationType":{"id":2752,"name":"Affiliated - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"5825305a-0ee1-4c1e-85ad-a66d00d19a60","firstName":"Kaylyn","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Kirkpatrick","primaryEmailAddress":"kirkpatrickkay@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":166346,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":88969,"phoneNumber":null,"state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
