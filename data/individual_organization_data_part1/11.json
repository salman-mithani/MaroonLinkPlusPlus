Each semester we partake in three large socials and one large fundraiser, as well as special interest group events. We encourage our members to join one of our four Committees, which meet monthly to build a great sisterhood. Our different Committees include Finance, External Affairs, Human Resources and Marketing. Within these committees, a member will receive not only more responsibility, but also opportunities for more socializing and fun!</p>\r\n<p>Our vision this year is to improve involvement through a friendly and social environment to build professional relationships.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why should I join?</strong></p>\r\n<p>AWIB is the prime organization for creating a network of women who can support each other in all their business endeavors.
