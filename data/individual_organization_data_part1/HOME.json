This organization will meet this goal by splitting up its efforts into two subsets: teaching the population of Texas A&amp;M the best way to help the homeless and doing local community service work with Non-profits around the BCS area that work people of a similar background to homeless. Teaching aggies the best way to help homeless is important because a large population of Texas A&amp;M has students that are from large cities and/or will work in large cities in the future and every large city has a homeless population. These students can bring the lessons they learn through H.O.M.E. back to their place of residence.&nbsp;</p>","summary":"The mission of this organization will be advocacy for the homeless population.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2017-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":8256780,"discussionId":8256780,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":null,"TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":null,"organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"8e4aae93-b52c-4604-8b41-a51c00e6b91e","firstName":"Stephanie","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Herman","primaryEmailAddress":"hermansteph@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":239470,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":"","organizationId":169321,"phoneNumber":"","state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
