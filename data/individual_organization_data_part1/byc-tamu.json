Our club has been instrumental in bringing to Texas A&amp;M community, the Science of holistic Yoga process. Yoga in the western world is typically known as a physical workout leading to flexibility and muscle tone. However Bhakti yoga is the highest and true form of yoga that caters to not just the body but also to mind, intellect and the soul. &nbsp;The word 'Bhakti' itself is a word that means 'loving devotional service' and our club is devoted to help students connect with the divine within and experience the true happiness and bliss on a spiritual platform.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also invite experienced yogis, traveling monks and distinguished speakers to discuss on various aspects of our existence such as Relationships, Satisfaction, what is happiness, Karma, mind, laws of mind, developing spiritual qualities etc. We hold vegetarian cooking classes especially considering student needs and condition. Our focus is to bring about a transformation, inside-out, and working on the ecology of the heart.&nbsp;Thus this holistic process of Bhakti yoga helps not just to integrate your body, mind and soul but also to integrate your existence !</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We &nbsp;serve Free vegetarian /vegan food at our all our sessions!!! Yeah thats true &nbsp;:-)</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&nbsp;Our Activities</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We meet on Fridays 7:00 - 9 pm on Campus and each of our sessions will comprise of the following activities</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yoga for Body or Hatha yoga can help you recognize your hidden physical and mental potentials. Through the continued practice of asanas, you will gain flexibility, strength and derive health benefits.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mantra or Kirtan Yoga: Mantra is a Sanskrit derivation of two words - \"man\", meaning the mind, and \"tra\", meaning deliverance.mantra means delivering the mind. From what you might ask? From the attachments of the mind. Only when the mind is not distracted can one remain steady in the yoga (linking) process.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Philosophy of Yoga helps us understand our identity as distinct from the body, mind and intellect. It helps us understand the goal and reason for existence.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yoga of the Soul involves operating from the level of spiritual consciousness. &nbsp;The yoga of the soul permeates into activities involving the body, mind and intellect, giving them spiritual substance. More importantly, this process helps develop a feeling ofananda i.e. happiness, contentment or satisfaction.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yoga of Food : This forms a core of the yoga system because it provides appropriate nourishment conducive for the sublime yoga process. A diet that is conducive for the body, mind, intellect and the soul. We conduct veg/vegan cooking classes and serve vegetarian /vegan food at our sessions.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our Motto &nbsp;: A holistic yoga system would involve considerations of all aspects of existence without discounting any one so that the net effect produced is towards the intended goal of the process. &nbsp;So speaking about us, our motto is to help 'Integrate body, mind and soul. Integrate your existence' We are passionate about the integrated approach to the practice of this ancient science of yoga and look forward to sharing it with the Texas A&amp;M community. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>","summary":"The main purpose of our club is :  a.
