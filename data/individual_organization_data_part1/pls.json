The Society's purpose was to inform students about law schools and the legal profession in general.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thirty-nine years later, the Society has over 400 members and is still growing. We offer students interested in law school the opportunity to exchange information, meet important contacts and get involved at Texas A&amp;M. Having law schools visit keeps students aware of the admissions criteria, what to expect in law school, and how to become a good admissions candidate. Law school trips help students decide which law school is best for them. Those unsure about law school may find the attorney panel and Mock LSAT beneficial.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Pre-Law Society offers members the chance to network with law school admission representatives, local attorneys, and other pre-law students. Additionally, you can become part of the Texas Aggie Bar Association and start networking while you are an undergrad! Students are an important resource for determining which classes or professors are good, where to intern, and LSAT preparation. Members gain leadership skills through involvement and become active at the University level. The socials are a great study break and a chance to have fun and meet new friends.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Connect with us!</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"TAMU Pre-Law Society \" href=\"https://instagram.com/tamu_prelaw_society/\" target=\"_blank\">@tamu_prelaw_society</a></p>\r\n<p><a title=\"TAMU Pre-Law Facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/tamupls\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/groups/tamupls</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","summary":"Provide information about law schools and the legal profession to members.
