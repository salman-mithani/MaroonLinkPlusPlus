This organization will provide hands on experiences in an effort to create a better understanding of Forensic Science and all fields that apply to it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Forensic &amp; Investigative Sciences major at Texas A&amp;M was established under the Department of Entomology in the College of Agricultural &amp; Life Sciences in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Aggie Forensic Investigative Science Organization</strong>&nbsp;was created shortly after in January of 2009. AFIS is a student-run organization and is open to both graduates and undergraduates of Texas A&amp;M University, affiliated with any major.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>AFIS offers many great opportunities for all those who join. Every meeting, AFIS tries to have a guest speaker come in and present the ins and outs of what they do. We&rsquo;ve had Crime Scene Investigators, Forensic Entomologists, Forensic Toxicologists, NCIS agents, FBI agents, Narcotics Investigators, Latent Print Examiners, Soil Scientists, Firearms and Toolmark Analysts, former CIA Agents, Arson Investigators, Forensic Anthropologists, and many others.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although the organization strives to be active in learning more about Forensic Sciences, members also participate in events throughout campus and the community such as The Big Event, Relay for Life, Aggieland Saturday, MSC Open House, and Science Night at our local schools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When we&rsquo;re not busy taking field trips, meeting new people, and staying active with the community, we&rsquo;re selling maggot art, having bake sales, and planning our annual banquet with the Department of Entomology!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, come meet with us&nbsp;the second and fourth Tuesday&nbsp;of every month at 7pm in Heep 102! We&rsquo;re always looking for new faces and fresh ideas!</p>","summary":"To spread knowledge to the community and all those with an interest in Forensic Science.This organization will provide hands on experiences in an effort to create a better understanding of Forensic Science and all fields that apply to it....","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1302466,"discussionId":1302466,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"http://afiso.tamu.edu","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AFISO/","TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":"31468ee3-7f60-4dbc-8f06-e29240e892b150009a4f-2067-4645-9337-a95c062bfacb.jpg","organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"004bfc8f-34dd-4ba9-b2f9-a5980099df2b","firstName":"Tammy","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Starr","primaryEmailAddress":"tammy.starr@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":166464,"addressType":0,"city":"College Station","country":"United States","deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":89087,"phoneNumber":null,"state":"TX","street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
