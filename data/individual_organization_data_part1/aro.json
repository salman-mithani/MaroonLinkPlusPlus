Often times, the students ARO works with believe higher education is unattainable due to their financial status. Our job, as ARO counselors, is to ensure them there are numerous ways to pursue higher education&mdash;including, but not limited to, scholarships, grants, and loans. Furthermore, it is our aim to educate students about the wide array of different educational options after high school including 4-year universities, local community colleges, and vocational schools. Most students ARO interacts with come from a background with much adversity and minimal educational support; in turn, ARO works to create a sense of self-efficacy for the students so they feel empowered to continue their education.</p>\r\n<p>To achieve these goals, ARO has 2 major trips annually. For the fall semester, ARO volunteers to counsel 8th grade students in the Bryan/College Station area. This event lasts 2 days and is held on the Texas A&amp;M campus. We provide students with resources and facilitate activities for their better understanding of higher education. In the spring, ARO will travel to Houston for a weeklong mentorship program in which we &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; students throughout the day and facilitate educational and team building activities. Being with students for an entire school week allows counselors to truly invest time in their future and educational paths.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>More information about our organization can be found at www.aggiesreachingout.com.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TO APPLY:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Go to aggiesreachingout.com and click the \"Become a Member\" tab.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Applications will be available Sunday, September 2nd at 8am and are due the following Sunday, September 9th at 11:59pm.&nbsp;</strong></p>","summary":"Aggies Reaching Out (ARO) strives to instill in eighth graders a sense of resourcefulness and ignite a more thorough understanding of how academic ambition can better life for both them and their families.\r\n\r\n","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2015-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":4108121,"discussionId":4108121,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"http://www.aggiesreachingout.com","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/aggiesreachingout/","TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":"80008537-137a-4733-b057-3e8e65b012789fec1024-c9fb-412c-946d-7e842c41b016.png","organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"dba3e8ee-8a93-4680-a496-a4e90119f1cd","firstName":"Emily","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Cantrell","primaryEmailAddress":"aggieemily@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":231071,"addressType":0,"city":"College Station","country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":127988,"phoneNumber":null,"state":"TX","street1":"235 John J Koldus","street2":"1236 TAMU Box 1116","zip":"77843-1236"}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
