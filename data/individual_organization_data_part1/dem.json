Through our organization, students network with other students, professors, advisors, and professionals in health-related fields. Our philanthropy, Camp For All, is also focused on children with disabilities, and students are given many opportunities to volunteer and raise money for the organization. Members gain responsibility and understand how to better serve society through volunteering with our philanthropy and many other sponsored volunteering events. We will provide social events for our members to help them develop interpersonal skills and form stronger ties within the fraternity. Our organization will also offer opportunities for members to develop leadership skills. Professional events will also be provided, such as interview workshops, resume workshops and speakers in a variety of health care fields. Each member will have individual responsibilities, as they will be required to do an appropriate share of organizing and overseeing events. Furthermore, our organization will offer numerous officer positions so that devoted members can broaden their responsibility and leadership skills. We accept anyone with plans on going into a health care related field, such as public health, medical school, PT school, dental school, grad school and vet school.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For more information on our chapter please visit:&nbsp;http://www.deltaepsilonmutamu.com</p>\r\n<p>For more information about the national organization please visit:&nbsp;http://www.deltaepsilonmu.org</p>\r\n<p>For more information about our philanthropy please visit:&nbsp;http://campforall.org</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","summary":"This organization provides a place were students across a variety of healthcare related fields can come together to advocate health education, advance their careers through professional development, and participate in service activities in the community.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1302357,"discussionId":1302357,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"http://www.deltaepsilonmutamu.com","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=demlambdapresident%40gmail.com&ctz=America%2FChicago","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/tamudem/","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/demtamu/","TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":"tamudem"},"profilePicture":"cf06a903-2977-4248-92d5-1fd369c87b44c72f1311-c710-4098-bdee-ef26dfdef3fd.png","organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"d3e322aa-f5b2-4a5e-abed-a53a0145501e","firstName":"Megyn","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Gordon","primaryEmailAddress":"megynelizabethh@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":166355,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":88978,"phoneNumber":"(281) 658-9649","state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
