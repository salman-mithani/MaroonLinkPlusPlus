We own a boat and a selection of slalom, trick, jump skis, and wakeboards so all you have to do is ski!</p>\r\n<p>The team will travel to&nbsp;three to four&nbsp;tournaments to compete each semester. When the team travels to tournaments&nbsp;club members who are not competing are&nbsp;encouraged to travel with the team and compete in B-Team events. We travel all over Texas and Louisiana to attend tournaments for the South Central region.</p>\r\n<p>The South Central region consists of Louisiana-Monroe, Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana State, Texas, Texas State,&nbsp;Texas A&amp;M,&nbsp;Baylor and Arkansas.</p>\r\n<p>Collegiate Water Ski tournaments consist of 3 events: Slalom, Trick and Jump. Each event is explained below.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Slalom:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The general idea in slalom is to ski around a set of balls in the slalom course. The course consists of six turn-balls, a set of gates at each end, and a set of boat guides, which run down the middle.</p>\r\n<p>The skier must pass in between (not over) the gates at each end, and pass on&nbsp;the outside of each turn ball to receive credit for a \"pass\". Each time the course is completed, the boat speed is increased, and the skier is brought back through the course.</p>\r\n<p>Once the maximum speed is reached, the rope length is decreased: 15' off, 22' off, 28' off, 32' off, 35' off, 38' off, 39 1/2' off, 41' off. \"Off\" refers to the amount of rope removed from a 75' rope (e.g. 15' off is a 60' rope from boat to skier). The skier also has the option to start at any of the available rope lengths. However, the skier does not receive credit for the buoys at that length until he runs a full pass at the highest allowable speed.The skier may choose to start at any speed above his/her minimum allowable speed (24mph female, 26mph male) in two mph increments (e.g. 30, 32, 34 etc). However, the skier must complete the opening pass to receive credit for the speeds below his starting speed. If he falls on his opening pass, he only receives credit for the number of buoys he got around on that pass.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Trick:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Trick, like gymnast on the water, combines cat-like agility with Herculean strength to perform as many different tricks as possible in 20 seconds. Trick skiing is done on a ski that is 40\" to 45\" long and about 10\" wide. The ski has no fins, making spinning and rotation easy, but balance hard. In competition, trick skiing is scored on the tricks that the skier can do within a 20 second period. The tricks are given a pre-assigned point value, and these skier scores are used for skier placement.</p>\r\n<p>Wakeboarding can be performed in competition instead of trick skiing but the point values per trick are cut in half due to wakeboarding being less difficult.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jump:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Jumping is defiantly one of the most exciting of the three events. The thrill of jumping can only be truly understood one way, to do it! Jumping is performed on two wide skis with special sloped, plastic fins. The boat will drive next to the ramp. The skier cuts out and skis over the ramp. The speed at which the jumper hits the ramp and the distance of his or her jump depends on many factors. Speed into the ramp is one of them. Maximum collegiate boat speed for women is 30 mph and 32 mph for men. But the key to distance is the speed the skier travels, not the boat. The harder the skier cuts to the ramp, the more speed is generated, thus making you go farther and higher.</p>\r\n<p>The Texas A&amp;M Waterski Club is always looking for new members. Whether you are a seasoned pro, a recreational skier, or someone who is interested in simply getting on top of the water; we welcome you! Below are some frequently asked questions from prospective new members.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>2018 Fall Tournament Schedule</strong></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Hog Wild (Scott, AR): September 8th-9th</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Bayou Classic (Monroe, LA): September 15th-16th&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Regionals (Katy, TX): September 29th-30th</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Nationals (Martindale, TX): October 11th-13th</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Water Ski Club FAQ</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>I am not very good at skiing, will I fit in?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are many people who join our club just for their love of the water! There is always going to be someone who never been on a competition ski course, jumped off a jump ramp or done trick skiing. We enjoy teaching people to do new things so don't be shy!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>What does the lake have to offer?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We have equipment for use by club members; slalom skis, trick skis, jump skis, jackets, wakeboards, wakeskates, ropes, handles, jump ramp, and a boat.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&nbsp;<strong>What are the dues?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Dues for this club is $300 for this semester.

This is for as much skiing as you want until. *if you want to see what we are like, we can allow you to come out for your first time for free! We can only allow this once.
