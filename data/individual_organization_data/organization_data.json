I'm a SkillsUSA 2015 National Champion photographer. I've learned how to create professional results from close to nothing, so don't hesitate to shoot me a question. I primarily shoot Nikon, and I&nbsp;currently have a Nikon d3200, a Nikon d5500, a Nikon d800, Fujifilm x100s, and a few film cameras. My special niche in photography is portraiture and fashion.</p>\r\n<p><strong>VP &amp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Treasurer - Byron Mitchell</strong></p>\r\n<p>Howdy, My name is Byron Mitchell, and I am a senior Communication student. I began photography in high school using a point and shoot. I finally purchased a medium range dslr (my Canon t5) about a year ago. I don't fancy myself an amazing photographer, but I'm willing to work on myself and help others when possible. If you need anything let me know. I hope you learn a lot in this club.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Event/Activity Planner - Cooper McCain</strong></p>\r\n<p>Howdy! My name is Cooper McCain, and I&rsquo;m a senior Industrial Distribution major. I&rsquo;ve always loved to take photos ever since I was a kid. However, it wasn&rsquo;t until last January when I got my first camera, a Nikon D5500. Today I shoot with my beloved Nikon D750. I don&rsquo;t stick to any type of photography, as I pretty much take photos in spontaneous moments when I see something breathtaking, including my girlfriend. Today, I typically find myself taking photos of landscapes, weather, the night sky, and anything else nature related because nature is what I&rsquo;ve always loved to photograph most.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Creativity Director - Jose Almazan</strong></p>\r\n<p>Howdy! I&rsquo;m Jose Almazan, and I am a senior University Studies in Architecture major from Laredo, Texas. At first, photography was just an escape from day to day life in high school. However, after a while of immersing myself in the history, books, and videos I began to take it more serious and developed it into a hobby. A few months after graduation I picked up my first DSLR and later my first film camera. Since then I&rsquo;ve devoted a large portion of my time to learn as much as I can about photography and honing my skills to help others interested in the craft. Currently, I use both digital and film (primarily Sony A7III and Nikon FE) and will shoot anything from Astro to Portraits to Landscapes and Abstracts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Member Outreach/Historian - Brittany Baysinger</strong></p>\r\n<p>Howdy! My name is Brittany Baysinger, I am a senior Communications &amp; Journalism major. I have been doing photography for 3 years, and I am excited to keep learning along with y&rsquo;all! I shoot mainly on a Canon, but I can always help you out with your camera if you need it. I specialize in macro and nature, but I try to work in all forms of photography! I can&rsquo;t wait to get to know y&rsquo;all better; and as your member outreach officer, please always feel free to say howdy <img class=\"x_x_x_x__1ift x_x_x_x__2560 x_x_x_x_img\" src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/fa5/1.5/16/1f642.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude42\" /> My goal for the club is to help foster new connections and friendships among the students and peers of the photography field. Welcome to the club!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Member Outreach/Historian - Ian Paul Terry</strong></p>\r\n<p>Howdy,&nbsp;my name is Ian Paul Terry, and I&rsquo;m a Junior studying Finance here at TAMU. I picked up a Nikon d3400 July of 2017 because I wanted to take better pictures of my cat, and now I specialize in portraiture and weddings! I&rsquo;d consider myself more of a creative photographer because I love thinking outside the box and using very simple things to make very cool effects!

Each speaker is assigned an evaluator who will provide them with specific, positive feedback.</p>\r\n<p>2. Table Topics - One member each week thinks of a series of questions related by a common theme. Members and guests have the opportunity to practice impromptu speaking by briefly answering one of these questions in front of the audience. Don't worry, participatiton&nbsp;is optional!</p>\r\n<p>3. Evaluations - Each evaluator provides the feedback for the speaker they critiqued at the beginning of the meeting.

WCS developed from traditional swing of the Roaring '20s, but it is infused with a unique California style. The fun of WCS comes from the unique musicality and improvisation danced in each song, which either partner can initiate, and the follower being able to \"play\" within the pattern the leader leads. Beginners can easily master its basic steps, while advanced dancers will be enthralled with creating clever tricks and new moves.</p>\r\n<p>For you knowledge junkies, here is some history of the dance: <a href=\"http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3wcs1.htm\"> http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3wcs1.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_block-block-4\" class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_clear-block x_x_x_x_x_x_x_block x_x_x_x_x_x_x_block-block\">\r\n<h2>Lessons</h2>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_content\">\r\n<p>We hold Level 1 and Level 2 lessons&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> <strong>at the Aerofit Center </strong></span>(<strong>1900 West Villa Maria Road in Bryan</strong>).

Level 1 repeats every six weeks where new dancers are allowed to&nbsp;join&nbsp;the class the first and second weeks.

We believe deeply in the importance of law as the mechanism that governs the relationships between and among the individuals and institutions that form our society, and we recognize the direct relationship between legal theory and the broader political debate about the kind of society in which we live.</p>\r\n<p>In recent years, the view has been ascendant that the traditional values of compassion and respect for human dignity have little or no place in legal discourse. This view permeates all aspects of legal debate: academic scholarship, judicial interpretation, and debate about laws proposed for enactment. The cornerstone of this legal view is an approach to understanding the United States Constitution that is essentially devoid of concern for the way in which the law affects the lives of the people who make up the nation in which we live.</p>\r\n<p>We believe, contrary to this conservative orthodoxy, that the law, and, in particular, the Constitution, serves human values. We believe that the Constitution is a charter of liberty, the blueprint for a noble and unique experiment designed to prevent the excesses of government in order to protect the human dignity necessary for individuals to realize the full potential of their lives. The goal of the Constitution, and the United States it created, is to permit people to succeed in the \"pursuit of happiness,\" one of the inalienable rights this nation explicitly was founded to secure to the American people.</p>\r\n<p>We believe that the Constitution, and by extension, many other areas of American law, can be understood only by reference to principles of decency, reason, humanity and compassion. We believe that those who enforce the law must have concern for the way in which it affects the lives of the people who make up the nation in which we live. And we believe these principles should form a starting point for enactment, as well as interpretation, of the law.</p>","Summary":"The Texas A&M University School of Law's chapter of the American Constitution Society, a progressive legal organization founded on the principle that the law should be a force to improve the lives of all people.

Our club has been instrumental in bringing to Texas A&amp;M community, the Science of holistic Yoga process. Yoga in the western world is typically known as a physical workout leading to flexibility and muscle tone. However Bhakti yoga is the highest and true form of yoga that caters to not just the body but also to mind, intellect and the soul. &nbsp;The word 'Bhakti' itself is a word that means 'loving devotional service' and our club is devoted to help students connect with the divine within and experience the true happiness and bliss on a spiritual platform.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also invite experienced yogis, traveling monks and distinguished speakers to discuss on various aspects of our existence such as Relationships, Satisfaction, what is happiness, Karma, mind, laws of mind, developing spiritual qualities etc. We hold vegetarian cooking classes especially considering student needs and condition. Our focus is to bring about a transformation, inside-out, and working on the ecology of the heart.&nbsp;Thus this holistic process of Bhakti yoga helps not just to integrate your body, mind and soul but also to integrate your existence !</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We &nbsp;serve Free vegetarian /vegan food at our all our sessions!!! Yeah thats true &nbsp;:-)</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&nbsp;Our Activities</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We meet on Fridays 7:00 - 9 pm on Campus and each of our sessions will comprise of the following activities</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yoga for Body or Hatha yoga can help you recognize your hidden physical and mental potentials. Through the continued practice of asanas, you will gain flexibility, strength and derive health benefits.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mantra or Kirtan Yoga: Mantra is a Sanskrit derivation of two words - \"man\", meaning the mind, and \"tra\", meaning deliverance.mantra means delivering the mind. From what you might ask? From the attachments of the mind. Only when the mind is not distracted can one remain steady in the yoga (linking) process.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Philosophy of Yoga helps us understand our identity as distinct from the body, mind and intellect. It helps us understand the goal and reason for existence.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yoga of the Soul involves operating from the level of spiritual consciousness. &nbsp;The yoga of the soul permeates into activities involving the body, mind and intellect, giving them spiritual substance. More importantly, this process helps develop a feeling ofananda i.e. happiness, contentment or satisfaction.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yoga of Food : This forms a core of the yoga system because it provides appropriate nourishment conducive for the sublime yoga process. A diet that is conducive for the body, mind, intellect and the soul. We conduct veg/vegan cooking classes and serve vegetarian /vegan food at our sessions.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our Motto &nbsp;: A holistic yoga system would involve considerations of all aspects of existence without discounting any one so that the net effect produced is towards the intended goal of the process. &nbsp;So speaking about us, our motto is to help 'Integrate body, mind and soul. Integrate your existence' We are passionate about the integrated approach to the practice of this ancient science of yoga and look forward to sharing it with the Texas A&amp;M community. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>","Summary":"The main purpose of our club is :  a.

It&rsquo;s the right to feel safe no matter what decisions you make for your own body.</p>\r\n<p><br />&middot;<strong>Complex</strong><strong> answer</strong>: It&rsquo;s a social and political movement that combines social justice and reproductive rights. Reproductive Justice aims to provide all people with the economic, social, and political power and resources to make healthy and informed decisions about their own bodies, body expression, sexuality, and reproduction.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is intersectionality?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&middot;Simple answer</strong>: It&rsquo;s the idea that all people are connected and no one lives a single-issue life. It&rsquo;s the idea that we are stronger united.</p>\r\n<p><br />&middot;<strong>Complex answer</strong>: It describe the interconnectedness and overlap of social structures such as class, race, gender and more which perpetuate the systems of discrimination and oppression around the world. Our group takes an intersectional approach to justice, because the only way we can truly make change is to be united. New work in the Reproductive Justice movement is also including post-colonial activism.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What does F.R.E.E.&nbsp;do?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&middot;We are an educational organization that focuses on the intersectionality of reproductive justice through events such as bimonthly meetings, tabling events, condom crawls, and various other activities.&nbsp;We also put on events such as&nbsp;<em>The Vagina Monologues</em> and&nbsp;<em>Out of Silence: Abortion Stories from the 1 in 3 Campaign.</em></p>\r\n<p>&middot;We are <strong>not</strong> a debate club. Any requests for such an event will be declined. We are also <strong>not</strong> a political organization. We believe that Reproductive Justice should not be a political issue; RJ is a right that anyone should have access to.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What does it mean to be pro-choice?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&middot;Simple answer</strong>: It means that we believe that every person should have the legal and social right and ability to access to the entire spectrum of choices about how to best approach their pregnancy. It also means we believe that the only person who can make the right decision about how to approach their pregnancy is the pregnant individual.</p>\r\n<p>&middot;<strong>Complex answer</strong>: It means that we believe that every person should have the legal and social right and ability to access to the entire spectrum of choices about how to best approach their pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>This includes the right to access and have complete, unbiased information about all possible choices regarding a pregnancy; possible choices include the right to prenatal care and postnatal care, to continue a pregnancy and become a parent, to end a pregnancy through abortion, to continue a pregnancy and give the child up for adoption, or to choose surrogacy. People should have the right to access medical care if they experience a miscarriage, the post baby blues, postpartum psychosis, etc. We believe that people should not be criminalized for the path they individually choose to take.</p>\r\n<p>Our personal beliefs (our members' beliefs) about abortion, adoption, prenatal care, postnatal care, and surrogacy should only apply to our own lives.</p>\r\n<p>It is entirely possible to not consider abortion as a possible choice for yourself and to be pro-choice. This is because being pro-choice is believing that the choice of how to approach a pregnancy can only be determined by the individual who is pregnant and anyone who the pregnant individual voluntarily chooses to involve.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is a Condom Crawl?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&middot;Members and volunteers distribute condoms and Northgate after members of the organization prepare condoms that have been donated to us by <a href=\"http://amplifyyourvoice.org/gacc-about\">The Great American Condom Campaign</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-gulf-coast\">Planned Parenthood</a>, and <a href=\"https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/organization/pca/about/urge.org\">Unite for Reproductive &amp; Gender Equity (URGE)</a>&nbsp;by taping (<strong>not</strong> stapling) coupons, our contact information, or fun facts to them and putting them in bags.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are T<em>he Vagina Monologues</em>?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&middot;<a href=\"http://www.eveensler.org/plays/the-vagina-monologues/\">The Vagina Monologues</a>&nbsp;is a play created by Eve Ensler made up of monologues which address taboo topics about vaginas.

FLARE provides freshmen with the tools and resources to become stronger leaders, both on campus and within the Bryan-College Station community.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Our Purpose:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>FLARE aims to create a welcoming environment for freshmen to gain exposure to the College of Liberal Arts, promote unity among liberal arts majors, create unique educational experiences outside of the classroom, promote and support diversity throughout the student body, coordinate events for liberal arts students, and to represent the College of Liberal Arts through community service projects.</p>\r\n<p><br /> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>How FLARE Works:</strong></span><br /> <br /> FLARE is composed of 3 junior directors, 11-14 sophomore counselors and 50-60 freshmen members. All staff members have been a part of FLARE previously. Our size enables us to create a dynamic environment for freshmen to make a big impact within the Texas A&amp;M community and foster strong friendships within the organization.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> General meetings are held at 7:00pm every Tuesday night. During this time FLARE comes together to develop as a group. This is usually accomplished by inviting guest speakers who have valuable lessons to offer to our enrichment. Past speakers have included the Dean of Liberal Arts, James Olson from the Bush School, and many professors from the College of Liberal Arts. We also use this time to allow committees to update the organization on their projects and to keep FLARE connected as a whole.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Committees:&nbsp;</strong></span><br /> Freshmen are placed into one of five committees, each headed by two chairs/counselors. This allows for each member to work on projects that are specific to their interests.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The <strong>Public Relations (PR)\u200b</strong> committee deals with maintaining FLARE&rsquo;s image on various social<br /> media platforms, designing, ordering, collecting funds, and maintaining communication with<br /> manufacturers of FLARE apparel. PR is also responsible for co-planning and co-organizing the<br /> Spring Semester all-FLO event.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /> The <strong>Internal Relations (IR)</strong> \u200bcommittee works to keep all FLARE members connected by<br /> planning and putting on our socials! We also work to build and strengthen friendships between<br /> flarians by working with the buddy system and ensuring that everyone feels included. We also<br /> collaborate with the directors for Fall and Spring Retreats to showcase our members at the end<br /> of each semester.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Special Activities and Fundraising\u200b</strong> deals with planning and overseeing important events for<br /> FLARE, including Parents Night and the Winter Formal, as well as attending to all matters<br /> involving raising money for the FLO throughout the year by various means, including organizing<br /> profit shares with local restaurants.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /> The <strong>Community Outreach committee (COMOUT)\u200b</strong> in FLARE is (as the name implies) the<br /> service committee. We coordinate volunteering opportunities for our FLARE members and help<br /> our organization improve the university and Bryan/College Station area. Internally we help<br /> FLARE members make new connections within FLARE as well as the university as a whole.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /> The <strong>Cultural Inclusion and Academics (CIA)\u200b</strong> committee is in charge of providing<br /> academic support and cultural exploration for liberal arts students within FLARE. We help<br /> students excel in the classroom and the university by bringing faculty, organizations, and other<br /> inspirational speakers to discuss opportunities a Liberal Arts degree has. Along with hosting<br /> study hours throughout the week, we plan day trips for the purpose of cultural enrichment,<br /> including outings to traditional Aggie events.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Social Activities:</strong></span><br /> For the social aspect of FLARE, each member is placed into a family.&nbsp;Families are led by two counselors and are small groups that enable the freshmen to meet others in FLARE outside of their committee. These groups hangout together and do various activities and competitions throughout the semester that enable growth and fun.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tons of extra activities are offered throughout the year to give flarians a chance to relax and have fun together. Many socials are put on as well as a Fall and Spring Retreat and a Winter Formal. Groups often go together to movie nights and RenFest or host Girls and Guys nights. We also participate in FLO-Bowl (powderpuff football) and Bump Set FLO (our annual All-FLO Volleyball tournament) and are always open to more activities!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>FLARE will be hosting informationals:</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Monday, Sept. 4th 7pm MSC 2405<br /> Tuesday, Sept. 5th 7pm ANTH 237</p>\r\n<p>Come out and learn about all of the opportunities our student organization has to give!

We propose to be an organization in the service of over 800 Indian graduate students at Texas A&amp;M University.<br /> <br /> Our student leaders have recognized that the issues faced by Indian graduate students and their needs are unique to this demographic. These graduate students come from a variety of backgrounds, and face many challenges with transitioning to a distinctly new system of rules and procedures. With a view to addressing these issues, our mission is based on the following key objectives:<br /> <br /> 1) Advocacy<br /> <br /> Many Indian graduate students face serious challenges in coping with the challenges of the university requirements, and on many occasions, they are unaware of the resources available on campus to help resolve their issues. Consequently, there needs to be an organization that can lend a voice to this group of students, and also promote involvement at forums aimed towards university-level policy planning efforts. With these aims in mind, the IGA proposes to work with agencies like the OGS and GSC, among others, to facilitate their efforts with a focused group of the campus community.<br /> <br /> 2) Networking<br /> <br /> There is an urgent need to develop and maintain a strong networking resource that includes members from the current graduate school community, academia, industry professionals and the alumni. It is of utmost importance for the graduate students to be well-informed about the developments pertaining to their experiences at graduate school and beyond. Through events like socials, information sessions and others, IGSA plans to offer a platform for students to develop a strong network base that is both resourceful as well as engaging. <br /> <br /> 3) Mentoring<br /> <br /> A serious lack of mentorship at a departmental level for our graduate students has been observed. Incoming Indian graduate students need guidance to step into the daily routines and workings of the department/courses/research. IGA plans to have departmental points-of-contact for all the major departments and schools on campus who can help the students based on their personal experiences and valuable resources in the form of other similar departmental representatives. The availability of such mentorship will help the students absorb core Aggie values, which, along with traditional Indian values, which will help the graduate students become healthy and successful Aggies.</p>","Summary":"Our purpose is to serve Indian graduate students (those already on campus as well as the new incoming ones) and their families at Texas A&M University.

The group was initially brought together by Manuel Chrysaloras, a Greek scholar that taught at the University, in response to physical attack, robbery and harassment of the University's patrons. It was this group that inspired the Ritual and beliefs of modern day Kappa Sigma.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kappa&nbsp;Sigma in America was founded one chilly evening in the fall of 1869, as&nbsp;five students&nbsp;attending the&nbsp;University of Virginia&nbsp;in&nbsp;Charlottesville&nbsp;gathered in&nbsp;William Grigsby McCormick's room at 46 East Lawn and planted the seed of Brotherhood. For many weeks the bonds of friendship&nbsp;had drawn these five together; now the need became clear for a formal structure to contain their feelings. Thus, not only did the Founders formalize their friendship, but they also created a fraternity steeped in the traditions of the past and dedicated to the Pursuit of Learning. The new brothers recorded their bond in a Constitution and in an Oath which set forth.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, Kappa Sigma chapters spread across the nation, producing good men with an indelible bond between one another. In 1880, Kappa Sigma established Alpha-Chi Chapter at Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, Illinois. This was the first northern chapter of a fraternity of southern origin. Five years later, expansion into the North began in earnest with Chi Chapter at Purdue University in 1885, and Psi Chapter at the University of Maine in 1886. Expansion to the West started in 1884 with Tau Chapter at the University of Texas and reached the Pacific coast in 1899 with Beta-Zeta Chapter at Stanford University.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1924, Kappa Sigma chartered its first Canadian chapter, Delta-Epsilon, at the University of Toronto in Ontario, and became an international Fraternity. With the acquisition in 1966 of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kappasigma.org/\" target=\"_new\">International Memorial Headquarters</a>&nbsp;at Charlottesville, Virginia, near the birthplace of American Kappa Sigma, a new and progressive concept of a professional staff developed. At this point, the Fraternity began experiencing growth that had not been seen since its inception nearly a hundred years prior, and has continued to this day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Kappa Sigma comprises over 200 chapters and colonies in both the United States and Canada, with over 200,000 men. Kappa Sigma is the sixth largest fraternity and has approximately 150,000 brothers in North America. The list of initiates is not only long, but also distinguished.&nbsp;Notable alumni&nbsp;are present in every conceivable profession and are making great impressions on the American landscape.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fraternity now exists now not only as singular chapters, but as an institution that has many mechanisms to support itself and foster growth, coordinated by the hundreds of volunteers nationwide. Every other year (odd years) the Fraternity stages a Grand Conclave for all initiates to come together and celebrate the accomplishments of the Brotherhood. Recent Conclaves have taken place in New Orleans, Pheonix and Memphis; the next one is scheduled for 2003 in Tampa, Florida. At these conventions, as with the regional Leadership Conferences that take place in off years, undergraduates are instructed in basic chapter operations and encouraged to share ideas in order to build a stronger presence at each and every campus where Kappa Sigma is located. These educational programs are funded by the Kappa Sigma Endowment Fund, which also disperses $250,000 in scholarships each year to deserving undergraduates through the the Scholarship/Leadership Program.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is evident from Kappa Sigma's past that the Fraternity is focused on being the top such organization in the nation through building an educated brotherhood of young men with the leadership skills necessary to succeed in all aspects of life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The future&nbsp;looks bright for the Men of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.</p>","Summary":"The Kappa Sigma fraternity is a mens organization on the Texas A&M campus.

YOUNG</h1>\r\n<p>Michael K. Young became the 25th President of Texas A&amp;M University on May 1, 2015, bringing a proven track record of academic leadership.</p>\r\n<p>As president and tenured Professor of Law at the University of Washington from 2011 to 2015, he led the nation&rsquo;s top public university in competing for federal research funding, as well as its ambitious plan to double the number of new companies based on UW research. He also launched the Global Innovation Exchange, a partnership in the State of Washington between the University of Washington, a major Chinese university and European universities. The University also more than doubled its fundraising during his tenure. Prior to that, he served as President and Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Utah. Under President Young&rsquo;s leadership, Utah raised its stature nationally and internationally, including becoming the nation&rsquo;s top university in the number of new companies generated from university research. The University also built over a million square feet of academic and research space under President Young&rsquo;s leadership.</p>\r\n<p>Before assuming the presidency at Utah, he was Dean and Lobingier Professor of Comparative Law and Jurisprudence at the George Washington University Law School, and he was a professor at Columbia University for more than 20 years. He also has been a visiting professor and scholar at three universities in Japan.</p>\r\n<p>A graduate of Harvard Law School, President Young has broad experience across legal, public service, and diplomatic arenas. He served as a law clerk to the late Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has held a number of government positions, including Deputy Under Secretary for Economic and Agricultural Affairs, and Ambassador for Trade and Environmental Affairs in the Department of State during the administration of President George H.W. Bush. Among many other international agreements, President Young worked extensively on the treaties related to German unification, as well as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Uruguay Round negotiations leading to the World Trade Organization, and the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development. Subsequently, President Young served eight years on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which he chaired on two separate occasions.</p>\r\n<p>He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a fellow of the American Bar Foundation.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_row\">\r\n<div class=\"x_large-3 x_medium-4 x_small-8 x_small-centered x_medium-uncentered x_columns\">\r\n<div class=\"x_tamu-logo\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_large-9 x_medium-8 x_small-12 x_columns\">\r\n<ul class=\"x_inline-list\">\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tamu.edu/\">Texas A&amp;M University</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://itaccessibility.tamu.edu/\">Web Accessibility</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tamu.edu/statements/index.html\">Site Policies</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Office of the President</strong><br />1246 TAMU<br />Texas A&amp;M University<br />College Station, TX 77843-1246</p>\r\n<p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:PresidentYoung@tamu.edu\">PresidentYoung@tamu.edu</a><br /><strong>Phone:</strong> (979) 845-2217<br /><strong>Fax:</strong> (979) 845-5027</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>","Summary":"\"Higher education is my passion; I am devoted to strengthening our young people and using education to make the world a better place.\"\r\n~ Michael Young","CategoryIds":[],"CategoryNames":[],"Status":"Active","Visibility":"Public"},{"@search.score":1.0,"Id":"89558","InstitutionId":3557,"ParentOrganizationId":85092,"BranchId":85092,"Name":"Office of the Vice President For Student Affairs","ShortName":"VPSA","WebsiteKey":"vpsa","ProfilePicture":"eb0efc64-8011-4d91-9533-bef632e43323bd76e55d-7b4a-402a-a49b-0befa7e62644.jpg","Description":"<p>The Division of Student Affairs provides exceptional services, facilities, programs, and experiences that enrich student learning and development, foster an inclusive campus community, preserve treasured Aggie Traditions and Spirit, and promote Aggie Core Values&mdash;Loyalty, Integrity, Excellence, Leadership, Selfless Service, and Respect&mdash;in support of the educational mission of Texas A&amp;M University.</p>","Summary":"The Division of Student Affairs provides exceptional services, facilities, programs, and experiences that enrich student learning and development, foster an inclusive campus community, preserve treasured Aggie Traditions and Spirit, and promote...","CategoryIds":["4949"],"CategoryNames":["Division of Student Affairs"],"Status":"Active","Visibility":"Public"},{"@search.score":1.0,"Id":"89550","InstitutionId":3557,"ParentOrganizationId":85092,"BranchId":85092,"Name":"Offices of the Dean of Student Life","ShortName":"Student Life","WebsiteKey":"studentlife","ProfilePicture":"80be22b0-7bd8-4c66-9f12-ed9c6a89c3e512ecf196-b39b-43f1-b0c5-62d37f267eae.jpg","Description":"<p>The Offices of the Dean of Student Life strive to enhance your opportunities as a student to participate fully in the University experience.

The Kappa Rho Chapter of Order of Omega was established at Texas A&amp;M University on April 4, 1990. Since its establishment, Order of Omega has recruited prestigous and well respected individuals from across the four Aggie Greek councils: Collegiate Panhellenic Council, Interfraternity Council, Multicultural Greek Council, and National Pan-Hellenic Council. The Kappa Rho chapter has completed countless hours of community service and has left a positive impact on the A&amp;M community. It is an honor for Aggie Greeks to be accepted&nbsp;into this exclusive society, and we are proud to accept new members each semester.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>OUR</strong>&nbsp;<strong>HISTORY</strong></p>\r\n<div id=\"x_x_x_x_comp-iejcbvlb\" class=\"x_x_x_x_s6\">Order of Omega was founded at the&nbsp;University of Miami&nbsp;in 1959 by a group of outstanding fraternity men, who felt that individuals in the Greek community should be recognized for their service to the fraternity system and the University. The idea of an honorary organization for fraternity men at the University of Miami is attributed to Parker F. Enright, the advisor to fraternities at the time. Enright later accepted a position at the University of Pittsburgh. He was also responsible for the founding of the Omega Chapter at the University of Pittsburgh in the spring of 1964.</div>\r\n<div id=\"x_x_x_x_comp-iejcbvlb\" class=\"x_x_x_x_s6\">\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_font_7\">The original constitution was approved by the Organizations Committee at the University of Miami on April 14, 1959, the recognized founding date. The first member class was initiated the following fall.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_font_7\">The Alpha chapter at&nbsp;Miami had long desired for their organization to expand to other colleges and universities. The Chapter gave its sanction to Dean Patrick W. Halloran to make initial inquiries and to further grant charters to universities that were accredited and interested in the purpose of The Order of Omega. On February 9, 1967, a Chapter was chartered at the&nbsp;University of Southern Mississippi. The Order of Omega voted to become a co-ed organization in the spring of 1977. There are now over five hundred chapters in the United States and Canada with approximately ten new chapters being chartered each year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_font_7\">Considering the age of the American college fraternity, the \"active honorary\" concept was long overdue. There must continue to be a common means by which the most outstanding fraternity men and women can stand united to further the philosophy of the college fraternity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_font_7\">Visit our national website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://orderofomega.org/\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>","Summary":"Order of Omega is one of the oldest and most prestigious Greek academic honor societies, with chapters all over the nation.

To apply for a dog from Patriot Paws, visit patriotpaws.org. Go to the Service Dog tab, click on Application, and download the application form. Follow the instructions to fill it out, and begin the process of regaining your independence!</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Q: What is a service animal?</strong></h1>\r\n<p>A: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a service animal as any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. Service animals perform some of the functions and tasks that the individual with a disability cannot perform for him or herself. A service animal is a medical device, not a pet. Service animals not only provide a specific service to their handlers, but also greatly enhance the quality of their lives with a new sense of freedom and independence.</p>\r\n<p>There are three types of Assistance Dogs:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Guide Dogs: for the blind and the visually impaired</li>\r\n<li>Hearing Dogs: for the deaf and the hard of hearing</li>\r\n<li>Service Dogs: for people with disabilities other than those related to vision or hearing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Dogs trained by Patriot Paws generally fall under the category of service dogs. Our dogs are trained for mobility assistance, post traumatic stress disorder, and seizure alert/response.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Q: How do I get involved with Patriot Paws of Aggieland?</strong></h1>\r\n<p>A: Please visit the 'Get Involved' tab to learn more about how to become a member, puppy sitter, puppy raiser, or officer of PPA. The 'News' tab and our Facebook page provide details about upcoming PPA events.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Q: Can I pet a service dog?</strong></h1>\r\n<p>A: Petting is at the handler's discretion. For service dogs in training, socialization is essential - so petting can be helpful, but only with the handler's approval. For working service dogs, petting is often is restricted since it may prevent the dog from doing his/her job correctly. Please do not be offended if a service dog handler does not allow you to pet their dog. Training comes first and foremost. Please do not ever pet a service dog without asking, and please do not call them to you, bark at them, or otherwise distract them! Interfering with or harrassing a service animal is prohibited under the ADA.</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Q: Why do your dogs get to go to class/restaurants/stores/etc?</strong></h1>\r\n<p>A: Under the ADA (federal law), service animals accompanied by their handlers have public access, but individual state laws regulate access for service dogs in training. Luckily, Texas state law provides service dogs in training with public access when accompanied by their trainer.</p>\r\n<p><em>Texas Human Resources Code, Chapter 121.003i</em></p>\r\n<p>An assistance animal in training shall not be denied admittance to any public facility when accompanied by an approved trainer who is an agent of an organization generally recognized by agencies involved in the rehabilitation of persons who are disabled as reputable and competent to provide training for assistance animals, and/or their handlers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For more information on Texas law regarding service animals, please visit http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/docs/HR/htm/HR.121.htm</p>\r\n<p>For more information on the ADA regarding service animals, please visit http://www.ada.gov/qasrvc.htm</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>","Summary":"Patriot Paws of Aggieland (PPA) is a group of dedicated individuals who assist in the training of service dogs for wounded veterans while simultaneously educating the public about service animals.","CategoryIds":["4960"],"CategoryNames":["Community/Volunteer Service"],"Status":"Active","Visibility":"Public"},{"@search.score":1.0,"Id":"89140","InstitutionId":3557,"ParentOrganizationId":85092,"BranchId":85092,"Name":"Percussion Studio","ShortName":"PS","WebsiteKey":"ps","ProfilePicture":"ca72f2e1-74ea-41bc-bcf6-7452422f24960208214c-e7dd-4a71-9609-b3d3a7c4cd2a.png","Description":"<p>To bring innovative percussion performance to the university and the surrounding community.

The goal was simply to form a group of motivated students who could work on interesting projects throughout the semester. However, the club soon gained support from other students of various engineering majors who also wished for an opportunity to apply their skills and knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>Today, TURTLE has grown to more than 40 members with several active projects, and it continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only student organization at Texas A&amp;M University that is specifically geared towards the field of robotics. We hope that the organization will continue to grow and become&nbsp;a premier robotics club for the university. Now, the official faculty advisor is <a href=\"http://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/people/hur-pilwon\" target=\"_blank\"> Dr. Pilwon Hur</a>, and many other faculty&nbsp;serve as our unofficial&nbsp;secondary advisers.</p>\r\n<p>TURTLE's main goal is to provide an opportunity for students to develop and showcase their novel ideas and problem-solving skills. In addition, emphasis&nbsp;is placed on team-work and leadership skills. Successful members of this organization learn to work with&nbsp;teammates from&nbsp;various disciplines&nbsp;to bring their assigned projects to completion. This includes&nbsp;building and testing final designs.</p>\r\n<p>Others goals of TURTLE include&nbsp;reaching out to high&nbsp;school students in special events and participating&nbsp;in robotics&nbsp;competitions whenever possible. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>TURTLE accepts undergraduate and graduate students of all engineering majors.&nbsp;Students in other areas of study who are interested in the organization are&nbsp;also encouraged to inquire about possible positions.&nbsp;For more specific information about our organization, click the tabs above, visit&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://studentactivities.tamu.edu/app/organization/profile/public/id/1392\">student activities profile,</a> or contact us directly.</p>","Summary":"The Texas A&M University Robotics Team and Leadership Experience (TURTLE) is an independent robotics club at Texas A&M which gives engineering students the opportunity to work on fun projects every semester.","CategoryIds":["4951"],"CategoryNames":["Academic-Agriculture"],"Status":"Active","Visibility":"Public"},{"@search.score":1.0,"Id":"150957","InstitutionId":3557,"ParentOrganizationId":85092,"BranchId":85092,"Name":"Texas A&M University Rocket Engine Design","ShortName":"TAMU RED","WebsiteKey":"rocketenginedesign","ProfilePicture":null,"Description":"<p>Our mission is to provide an avenue for students to develop an intuitive understanding of liquid rocket engines and liquid rocket engine design through an iterative process of designing, manufacturing, and testing engines capable of delivering small payloads to low earth orbit.

We own a boat and a selection of slalom, trick, jump skis, and wakeboards so all you have to do is ski!</p>\r\n<p>The team will travel to&nbsp;three to four&nbsp;tournaments to compete each semester. When the team travels to tournaments&nbsp;club members who are not competing are&nbsp;encouraged to travel with the team and compete in B-Team events. We travel all over Texas and Louisiana to attend tournaments for the South Central region.</p>\r\n<p>The South Central region consists of Louisiana-Monroe, Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana State, Texas, Texas State,&nbsp;Texas A&amp;M,&nbsp;Baylor and Arkansas.</p>\r\n<p>Collegiate Water Ski tournaments consist of 3 events: Slalom, Trick and Jump. Each event is explained below.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Slalom:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The general idea in slalom is to ski around a set of balls in the slalom course. The course consists of six turn-balls, a set of gates at each end, and a set of boat guides, which run down the middle.</p>\r\n<p>The skier must pass in between (not over) the gates at each end, and pass on&nbsp;the outside of each turn ball to receive credit for a \"pass\". Each time the course is completed, the boat speed is increased, and the skier is brought back through the course.</p>\r\n<p>Once the maximum speed is reached, the rope length is decreased: 15' off, 22' off, 28' off, 32' off, 35' off, 38' off, 39 1/2' off, 41' off. \"Off\" refers to the amount of rope removed from a 75' rope (e.g. 15' off is a 60' rope from boat to skier). The skier also has the option to start at any of the available rope lengths. However, the skier does not receive credit for the buoys at that length until he runs a full pass at the highest allowable speed.The skier may choose to start at any speed above his/her minimum allowable speed (24mph female, 26mph male) in two mph increments (e.g. 30, 32, 34 etc). However, the skier must complete the opening pass to receive credit for the speeds below his starting speed. If he falls on his opening pass, he only receives credit for the number of buoys he got around on that pass.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Trick:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Trick, like gymnast on the water, combines cat-like agility with Herculean strength to perform as many different tricks as possible in 20 seconds. Trick skiing is done on a ski that is 40\" to 45\" long and about 10\" wide. The ski has no fins, making spinning and rotation easy, but balance hard. In competition, trick skiing is scored on the tricks that the skier can do within a 20 second period. The tricks are given a pre-assigned point value, and these skier scores are used for skier placement.</p>\r\n<p>Wakeboarding can be performed in competition instead of trick skiing but the point values per trick are cut in half due to wakeboarding being less difficult.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jump:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Jumping is defiantly one of the most exciting of the three events. The thrill of jumping can only be truly understood one way, to do it! Jumping is performed on two wide skis with special sloped, plastic fins. The boat will drive next to the ramp. The skier cuts out and skis over the ramp. The speed at which the jumper hits the ramp and the distance of his or her jump depends on many factors. Speed into the ramp is one of them. Maximum collegiate boat speed for women is 30 mph and 32 mph for men. But the key to distance is the speed the skier travels, not the boat. The harder the skier cuts to the ramp, the more speed is generated, thus making you go farther and higher.</p>\r\n<p>The Texas A&amp;M Waterski Club is always looking for new members.

We accomplish our mission by providing essential conferences, seminars, educational materials, internships, and speakers to young people across the country.<br /> <br /> In 2011, Young America's Foundation unified with Young Americans for Freedom, which serves as the Foundation's chapter affiliate on college and high school campuses across the country. Founded by William F. Buckley, Jr. and a group of young conservatives in 1961 at his home in Sharon, Connecticut, Young Americans for Freedom today promotes to youth the principles of limited government, individual freedom, free enterprise, a strong national defense, and traditional values, as outlined in the Sharon Statement. The chapters accomplish this by participating in a wide range of campus initiatives, such as the 9/11: Never Forget Project, Freedom Week, and the GPA Redistribution Contest, among others; and by hosting prominent conservative speakers.</p>","Summary":"Young America's Foundation is committed to ensuring that increasing numbers of young Americans understand and are inspired by the ideas of individual freedom, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and traditional values...","CategoryIds":["4968"],"CategoryNames":["Social and Political Issues"],"Status":"Active","Visibility":"Public"},{"@search.score":1.0,"Id":"218558","InstitutionId":3557,"ParentOrganizationId":85092,"BranchId":85092,"Name":"Young Conservatives of Texas","ShortName":"YCT","WebsiteKey":"yct","ProfilePicture":null,"Description":"<p>Members of Young Conservatives of Texas at Texas A&amp;M work to promote principles of personal and economic freedom, limited government, and liberty in their daily lives.
