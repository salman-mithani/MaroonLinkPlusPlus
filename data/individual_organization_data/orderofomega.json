The Kappa Rho Chapter of Order of Omega was established at Texas A&amp;M University on April 4, 1990. Since its establishment, Order of Omega has recruited prestigous and well respected individuals from across the four Aggie Greek councils: Collegiate Panhellenic Council, Interfraternity Council, Multicultural Greek Council, and National Pan-Hellenic Council. The Kappa Rho chapter has completed countless hours of community service and has left a positive impact on the A&amp;M community. It is an honor for Aggie Greeks to be accepted&nbsp;into this exclusive society, and we are proud to accept new members each semester.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>OUR</strong>&nbsp;<strong>HISTORY</strong></p>\r\n<div id=\"x_x_x_x_comp-iejcbvlb\" class=\"x_x_x_x_s6\">Order of Omega was founded at the&nbsp;University of Miami&nbsp;in 1959 by a group of outstanding fraternity men, who felt that individuals in the Greek community should be recognized for their service to the fraternity system and the University. The idea of an honorary organization for fraternity men at the University of Miami is attributed to Parker F. Enright, the advisor to fraternities at the time. Enright later accepted a position at the University of Pittsburgh. He was also responsible for the founding of the Omega Chapter at the University of Pittsburgh in the spring of 1964.</div>\r\n<div id=\"x_x_x_x_comp-iejcbvlb\" class=\"x_x_x_x_s6\">\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_font_7\">The original constitution was approved by the Organizations Committee at the University of Miami on April 14, 1959, the recognized founding date. The first member class was initiated the following fall.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_font_7\">The Alpha chapter at&nbsp;Miami had long desired for their organization to expand to other colleges and universities. The Chapter gave its sanction to Dean Patrick W. Halloran to make initial inquiries and to further grant charters to universities that were accredited and interested in the purpose of The Order of Omega. On February 9, 1967, a Chapter was chartered at the&nbsp;University of Southern Mississippi. The Order of Omega voted to become a co-ed organization in the spring of 1977. There are now over five hundred chapters in the United States and Canada with approximately ten new chapters being chartered each year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_font_7\">Considering the age of the American college fraternity, the \"active honorary\" concept was long overdue. There must continue to be a common means by which the most outstanding fraternity men and women can stand united to further the philosophy of the college fraternity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_font_7\">Visit our national website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://orderofomega.org/\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>","summary":"Order of Omega is one of the oldest and most prestigious Greek academic honor societies, with chapters all over the nation.
