The pillars are: The cultivation of friendship among its members, the acquirement individually of a high degree of mental culture, and the attainment personally of a high standard of morality. Shortened, we refer to the principles as friendship, sound learning and rectitude.</p>\r\n<p>Helping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person&rsquo;s true self, and by learning from each other&rsquo;s strengths while helping to improve each other&rsquo;s weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his own. Rather than try to find young men to &ldquo;mold&rdquo; into some ideal, we celebrate the uniqueness of each individual and, through encouragement, values, example and brotherhood, empower every brother to exceed his personal expectations.</p>\r\n<p>Phi Delta Theta now has nearly 190 active chapters - <a href=\"http://www.aggiephidelt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> including Texas A&amp;M University's Texas Nu Chapter</a> - and colonies in 42 states and five Canadian provinces.&nbsp;The Fraternity has initiated more than 250,000 men and currently has more than 160,000 living alumni.&nbsp;There are over 100 recognized alumni clubs across the U.S. and Canada. The Fraternity operates from the General Headquarters building on South Campus Avenue, across from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.</p>","summary":"To promote a Standard for Brotherhood for gentlemen at Texas A&M University by accomplishing our three Cardinal Principles of Friendship, Sound Learning and Moral Rectitude.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1355151,"discussionId":1355151,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2752,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"http://tamu.phideltatheta.org","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/PhiDeltaThetaTexasNu/","TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":"aggiephidelt"},"profilePicture":"407433b9-24dc-47c1-abbf-321ac69d4ecbd5f6feaf-208e-40a1-a5e4-3e9efdcd0d3e.png","organizationType":{"id":2752,"name":"Affiliated - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"5a792690-c4e7-4614-8918-c15be2b8ba17","firstName":"Amado","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Martinez","primaryEmailAddress":"martineza21@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":171227,"addressType":0,"city":"College Station","country":"United States of America","deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":93979,"phoneNumber":"(817) 881-6206","state":"TX","street1":"501 Cooner St.","street2":null,"zip":"77840"}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
