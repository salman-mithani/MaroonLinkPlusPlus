WCS developed from traditional swing of the Roaring '20s, but it is infused with a unique California style. The fun of WCS comes from the unique musicality and improvisation danced in each song, which either partner can initiate, and the follower being able to \"play\" within the pattern the leader leads. Beginners can easily master its basic steps, while advanced dancers will be enthralled with creating clever tricks and new moves.</p>\r\n<p>For you knowledge junkies, here is some history of the dance: <a href=\"http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3wcs1.htm\"> http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3wcs1.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_block-block-4\" class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_clear-block x_x_x_x_x_x_x_block x_x_x_x_x_x_x_block-block\">\r\n<h2>Lessons</h2>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_content\">\r\n<p>We hold Level 1 and Level 2 lessons&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> <strong>at the Aerofit Center </strong></span>(<strong>1900 West Villa Maria Road in Bryan</strong>). The first class is Level 2 for those who already know the basic steps of West Coast (i.e. side passes, sugar push, whip, starter step, and tuck turn) and have permission of the instructors. Level 2 cycles through each semester, with dancers allowed to join in at the beginning of each set of six weeks. The second class is Level 1 for those who are just starting to learn the dance. Level 1 repeats every six weeks where new dancers are allowed to&nbsp;join&nbsp;the class the first and second weeks. We encourage that new dancers take the Level 1 class in addition to a private lesson with an instructor before moving up to Level 2, and those that take the Level 2 class stay for the Level 1 class to continue to work on their own basics and help out.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Come out and try your <strong>first lesson with us, free!</strong></span></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: small;\"><strong>8:00 to 9:00 pm - Level 2 Lesson</strong></span></h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: small;\"><strong>9:00 to 10:05 pm&nbsp;- Level 1 Lesson</strong></span></h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: small;\"><strong>10:00 to&nbsp;11:00 pm&nbsp;- Social Dancing</strong></span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Six-week sets:</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp; 1/26, 2/2, 2/9, 2/16, 2/23, 3/1</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp; 3/22, 3/29, 4/5, 4/12, 4/19, 4/26</p>\r\n<p><strong>Students&nbsp;</strong>(College and K-12)&nbsp;may either pay <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> $5 each Tuesday</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">$15 for a six-week membership</span>, or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">$25 for a semester membership</span> and <strong> non-students</strong> may either pay <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">$8 each Tuesday</span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">$25 for a six-week membership</span>, or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> $40 for a semester membership</span>.</p>\r\n<p>Aggie Westie members are entitled free admission to social dance events during the semester.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><a class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_feed-icon\" href=\"http://aggiewesties.tamu.edu/rss.xml\"><img title=\"Aggie Westies RSS\" src=\"https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/misc/feed.png\" alt=\"Syndicate content\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" /></a></p>","summary":"Aggie West Coast Swing Dance Club promotes west coast swing dancing both at Texas A&M University and in the Bryan/College Station area.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2014-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":2887106,"discussionId":2887106,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"http://www.aggiewesties.org","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/709481732462610/","TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":"162e74ab-7770-40ff-a418-e1f21aab6ab32d719687-9a89-4f59-8938-632fb98f1526.jpg","organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"2c981225-2b62-4e23-9161-a3b0009c9b77","firstName":"Sumana","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Datta","primaryEmailAddress":"sumad@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":201992,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":115935,"phoneNumber":null,"state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
