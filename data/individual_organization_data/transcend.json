It will serve as a support group for these students to connect with allies and others that identify as they do. It will work alongside existing LGBT organizations and institutions already in place to further the acceptance, recognition, and fair treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and especially transgender students on campus. Transcend will also serve as a reminder to prospective or incoming transgender students that there are others like them currently on campus, and despite TAMU's anti-LGBT reputation they will have a place on our campus. With that, Transcend will work with the university to help nullify it's current anti-LGBT reputation.</p>","summary":"Transcend will exist to better fit the needs of the growing population of students that identify in the transgender, bi-gender, no-gender, and gender nonconforming spectrum(s).","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2016-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":6331515,"discussionId":6331515,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":null,"TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":"f7b902b0-1a0c-4235-9884-2aeeb69089dd63865de1-9655-47c0-b703-9e1388f18a74.png","organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"036d94d4-659d-4f34-a86a-a3fc00d4ccd6","firstName":"Krista","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"May","primaryEmailAddress":"k-may01@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":257029,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":"","organizationId":157451,"phoneNumber":"","state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
