{"id":218128,"communityId":356,"institutionId":3557,"name":"Community of Blessing","shortName":"COB","nameSortKey":"C","websiteKey":"cob","email":null,"description":"<p>Community of Blessing is a branch of the larger ministry, Christian Mission to the Orient.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Texas A&amp;M Community of Blessing sends students to work along side medical staff and Thai student translators to operate a clinic with optical, health, pharmacy, and dental stations.&nbsp;<br /><br />The medical clinics take place in rural Northern Thai mountain areas, and are set up in existing local churches in those areas. These are often church plants, and the occurrence of medical clinics is a great opportunity for the locals to see Jesus' love in action and to learn about the existence of the churches.<br /><br />Texas A&amp;M students also have the opportunity to give back to the Thai student translators through fundraising for the Next Step Scholarship Fund. These Thai translators are college-aged students from orphanage backgrounds. The Next Step Initiative serves as a preventative measure against human trafficking by giving these students the means to attend Lanna Theological Center, a local Bible college operated by Christian Mission to the Orient. In Thailand, many college-aged students are deceived into human trafficking, but by putting them through a university that trains them in Christian leadership, they are matured and better-prepared to operate in the real world-- it's their \"Next Step\". These students later go on to fill ministerial roles and even plant churches, opening more doors for medical clinic operations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Through participation in Community of Blessing medical mission trips, A&amp;M students will get to know these Thai students-- they would love to practice their English!&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>","summary":"Community of Blessing's main focus is setting up and operating week-long medical clinics in rural Northern Thailand. Community of Blessing is part of a larger network of ministries that operate in Northern Thailand.
