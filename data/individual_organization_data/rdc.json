The sorority was formed by 14 women to unite females of different backgrounds through the bonds of sisterhood and to provide services in the best interests of the community as well as the University. Our Founding Mothers of the Alpha Chapter chose the letters of Rho Delta Chi in hopes to bring harmony among all ethnicities. Through sisterhood, we hope to nurture personal growth and self esteem as well as to provide an environment for social interaction. We offer scholarships and study guides which aid in academic achievement. Through philanthropy and other related activities, we hope to increase Asian Awareness and to assist communities in need. Through activities with fraternities and sororities on campuses, fundraisers, informals, formals, installation, and retreats, we hope to gain knowledge about each other and our diverse cultures. <br /> <br /> Texas A&amp;M is home to Beta Chapter.</p>","summary":"Rho Delta Chi Sorority, Inc. was established on January 17, 1991 as the first Asian American sorority at the University of California, Riverside.
