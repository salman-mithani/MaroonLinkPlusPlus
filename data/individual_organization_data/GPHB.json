We travel to Central America once per semester to establish five different infrastructural projects within communities. In addition to the infrastructure projects, Public Health Brigades also works with communities to provide health education to school-age children and adults in the community. The Public Health team collaborates with school teachers and other key community members to develop a curriculum that will directly address the communities&rsquo; needs, while volunteers prepare lessons for the children during each brigade. We recruit students from all over campus with no particular prior experience needed. Each of the communities served receives a brigade every 3 to 4 months with hopes of creating self sustaining communities by preventing disease. Between brigades, the in-country team maintains relationships with the communities to provide follow-up to ensure all projects and education were successful.</p>","summary":"Global Public Health Brigades is an international student-operated volunteer organization that aims to empower rural communities to prevent common illnesses through in-home infrastructural development, community leader training, and health education...","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2016-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":6021648,"discussionId":6021648,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":null,"TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":null},"profilePicture":null,"organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"61466f3e-8488-49db-a398-a258000285a8","firstName":"Natalie","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Nowland","primaryEmailAddress":"natalienowland@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
