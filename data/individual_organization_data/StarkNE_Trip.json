In the late 1960s, longtime MSC Director J. Wayne Stark recognized a need to give top Texas A&amp;M students access to the nation&rsquo;s premier law and graduate business programs. It was also important that the trip be available at a cost that wouldn&rsquo;t break the typical student&rsquo;s family budget. Stark called on the considerable power of his Aggie network to make that first trip happen in 1970.</p>\r\n<p>Delegates will visit the University of Chicago, Northwestern, Harvard, New York University, Columbia University, and the University of Pennsylvania. This trip will afford you the opportunity to meet with the recruiting administrators and current students of the schools, as well as network&nbsp;with former students at various receptions and events. You will also be able to observe actual law and business classes and tour the campuses and cities.</p>\r\n<p>2017 MSC Stark Northeast Trip: January 6-16, 2018</p>\r\n<p>Login to Maroon Link, then apply at <a title=\"StarkNE Tour 2018\" href=\"https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/submitter/form/start/136114\">bit.ly/StarkNE2018</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Applications due at noon, September 24, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>stark@msc.tamu.edu</p>","summary":"Prospective Law & MBA students visit U Chicago, Northwestern, Harvard, NYU, Columbia, and U Penn.
