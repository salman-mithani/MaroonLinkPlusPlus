These experiences are usually longer in term.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Leadership Education&nbsp;</strong>means opportunities for learning that is informed by theory or research. These experiences usually take place in a more formal setting, such as an academic course.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Leadership Training</strong>&nbsp;means opportunities for skill-based learning. These experiences usually take place in workshops, seminars, and trainings.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Participants in The Maroon &amp; White Leadership Fellows program will be committed to honing skills, developing an appreciation for lifelong learning, and striving to be an engaged citizen post-graduation. Throughout the program, participants will have one on one leadership coaching that will challenge them to reflect on their learning and map their leadership experiences over time. The program will culminate with a leadership capstone experience, the Leadership Engagement Project. Ultimately, participants will see their leadership journey as a lifelong learning process. When participants graduate from Texas A&amp;M University, they will leave with a deeper understanding of who they are as leaders and how they can make an impact in their respective communities.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>As you might have noticed, there is <strong>The </strong><strong>Maroon &amp; White Leadership Fellows</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>The </strong><strong>Maroon &amp; White Leadership Society</strong>.
