Our&nbsp;Texas A&amp;M chapter&nbsp;will recruit&nbsp;dedicated students, nurses, residents, pharmacists, dentists and doctors to volunteer on each trip.&nbsp;Global Brigades offers 7-9 day Medical Brigades in January and August that travel to Honduras, Panama and Nicaragua. During a Medical Brigade, volunteers have the opportunity to take vitals and patient history in triage, shadow licensed doctors in medical consultations, and assist in a pharmacy under the direction of licensed pharmacists. Each of our partner communities receives a brigade approximately twice a year. Between brigades, our in-country team maintains relationships with the communities to provide follow-up and to conduct Community Health Worker (CHW) trainings to empower local leaders to sustain a consistent level of healthcare. Electronic patient records are collected for future visitations and to monitor overall community health trends.</p>\r\n<p>Our current emphasis is to help the impoverished villages of Nicaragua. We will hold one trip per semester, taking place in January and August. Along with the medical brigades, students will visit several homes within the community to build sanitation units that aim to&nbsp;better the quality of life in these impoverished areas.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","summary":"Global Medical Brigades is a secular, international student-operated volunteer organization whose mission is to provide sustained health care to underserved communities throughout the world.
