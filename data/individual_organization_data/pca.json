It&rsquo;s the right to feel safe no matter what decisions you make for your own body.</p>\r\n<p><br />&middot;<strong>Complex</strong><strong> answer</strong>: It&rsquo;s a social and political movement that combines social justice and reproductive rights. Reproductive Justice aims to provide all people with the economic, social, and political power and resources to make healthy and informed decisions about their own bodies, body expression, sexuality, and reproduction.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is intersectionality?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&middot;Simple answer</strong>: It&rsquo;s the idea that all people are connected and no one lives a single-issue life. It&rsquo;s the idea that we are stronger united.</p>\r\n<p><br />&middot;<strong>Complex answer</strong>: It describe the interconnectedness and overlap of social structures such as class, race, gender and more which perpetuate the systems of discrimination and oppression around the world. Our group takes an intersectional approach to justice, because the only way we can truly make change is to be united. New work in the Reproductive Justice movement is also including post-colonial activism.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What does F.R.E.E.&nbsp;do?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&middot;We are an educational organization that focuses on the intersectionality of reproductive justice through events such as bimonthly meetings, tabling events, condom crawls, and various other activities.&nbsp;We also put on events such as&nbsp;<em>The Vagina Monologues</em> and&nbsp;<em>Out of Silence: Abortion Stories from the 1 in 3 Campaign.</em></p>\r\n<p>&middot;We are <strong>not</strong> a debate club. Any requests for such an event will be declined. We are also <strong>not</strong> a political organization. We believe that Reproductive Justice should not be a political issue; RJ is a right that anyone should have access to.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What does it mean to be pro-choice?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&middot;Simple answer</strong>: It means that we believe that every person should have the legal and social right and ability to access to the entire spectrum of choices about how to best approach their pregnancy. It also means we believe that the only person who can make the right decision about how to approach their pregnancy is the pregnant individual.</p>\r\n<p>&middot;<strong>Complex answer</strong>: It means that we believe that every person should have the legal and social right and ability to access to the entire spectrum of choices about how to best approach their pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>This includes the right to access and have complete, unbiased information about all possible choices regarding a pregnancy; possible choices include the right to prenatal care and postnatal care, to continue a pregnancy and become a parent, to end a pregnancy through abortion, to continue a pregnancy and give the child up for adoption, or to choose surrogacy. People should have the right to access medical care if they experience a miscarriage, the post baby blues, postpartum psychosis, etc. We believe that people should not be criminalized for the path they individually choose to take.</p>\r\n<p>Our personal beliefs (our members' beliefs) about abortion, adoption, prenatal care, postnatal care, and surrogacy should only apply to our own lives.</p>\r\n<p>It is entirely possible to not consider abortion as a possible choice for yourself and to be pro-choice. This is because being pro-choice is believing that the choice of how to approach a pregnancy can only be determined by the individual who is pregnant and anyone who the pregnant individual voluntarily chooses to involve.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is a Condom Crawl?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&middot;Members and volunteers distribute condoms and Northgate after members of the organization prepare condoms that have been donated to us by <a href=\"http://amplifyyourvoice.org/gacc-about\">The Great American Condom Campaign</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-gulf-coast\">Planned Parenthood</a>, and <a href=\"https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/organization/pca/about/urge.org\">Unite for Reproductive &amp; Gender Equity (URGE)</a>&nbsp;by taping (<strong>not</strong> stapling) coupons, our contact information, or fun facts to them and putting them in bags.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are T<em>he Vagina Monologues</em>?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&middot;<a href=\"http://www.eveensler.org/plays/the-vagina-monologues/\">The Vagina Monologues</a>&nbsp;is a play created by Eve Ensler made up of monologues which address taboo topics about vaginas. The topics addressed range from funny topics to more serious topics including lack of consent. This play is not intended to define what a woman is or a what a person with a vagina is. It is simply a play about the personal experiences of different people who have a vagina. (The play has a specific set of monologues.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is&nbsp;<em>Out of Silence</em><em>: Stories from the 1 in 3 Campaign</em>?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&middot;The <a href=\"https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/organization/pca/about/1in3campaign.org\"> 1 in 3 Campaign</a> is an abortion positive campaign which uses the statistic that 1 in 3 people will have an abortion in their lifetime.&nbsp;<em>Out of Silence</em> is a play that showcases some of the thousands of shared abortion stories given to the campaign. We encourage more before to #ShoutYourAbortion to help build community and de-stigmatize abortion.</p>","summary":"Feminists for Reproductive Equity & Education (F.R.E.E.) is a non-partisan student activist group at TAMU fighting for the Reproductive Justice (RJ) movement.
