Today, the team has grown as an organization and is sponsored by the College of Liberal Arts. The team competes in 11 individual speaking and acting events, as well as Parliamentary and Lincoln-Douglas styles debate. Our decree is to compete at a national level while impacting both our community and the world at a grassroots level. It&rsquo;s not enough to just give empty speeches at TAMU, instead we strive to turn our debate experience and our speech topics into real movements and community involvement that we feel both betters the competition, the community, and ourselves.&nbsp;For more information contact: Cody Williams (President) at comwill@tamu.edu. Meetings for Fall 2018 are TBD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","summary":"The Texas A&M Speech and Debate team competes in regional and national intercollegiate speech and debate activities.
