{"id":94033,"communityId":356,"institutionId":3557,"name":"Indian Graduate Students Association","shortName":"IGSA","nameSortKey":"I","websiteKey":"igsa","email":"igsa@igsa.tamu.edu","description":"<p>Our purpose is to serve Indian graduate students (those already on campus as well as the new incoming ones) and their families at Texas A&amp;M University. We propose to be an organization in the service of over 800 Indian graduate students at Texas A&amp;M University.<br /> <br /> Our student leaders have recognized that the issues faced by Indian graduate students and their needs are unique to this demographic. These graduate students come from a variety of backgrounds, and face many challenges with transitioning to a distinctly new system of rules and procedures. With a view to addressing these issues, our mission is based on the following key objectives:<br /> <br /> 1) Advocacy<br /> <br /> Many Indian graduate students face serious challenges in coping with the challenges of the university requirements, and on many occasions, they are unaware of the resources available on campus to help resolve their issues. Consequently, there needs to be an organization that can lend a voice to this group of students, and also promote involvement at forums aimed towards university-level policy planning efforts. With these aims in mind, the IGA proposes to work with agencies like the OGS and GSC, among others, to facilitate their efforts with a focused group of the campus community.<br /> <br /> 2) Networking<br /> <br /> There is an urgent need to develop and maintain a strong networking resource that includes members from the current graduate school community, academia, industry professionals and the alumni. It is of utmost importance for the graduate students to be well-informed about the developments pertaining to their experiences at graduate school and beyond. Through events like socials, information sessions and others, IGSA plans to offer a platform for students to develop a strong network base that is both resourceful as well as engaging. <br /> <br /> 3) Mentoring<br /> <br /> A serious lack of mentorship at a departmental level for our graduate students has been observed. Incoming Indian graduate students need guidance to step into the daily routines and workings of the department/courses/research. IGA plans to have departmental points-of-contact for all the major departments and schools on campus who can help the students based on their personal experiences and valuable resources in the form of other similar departmental representatives. The availability of such mentorship will help the students absorb core Aggie values, which, along with traditional Indian values, which will help the graduate students become healthy and successful Aggies.</p>","summary":"Our purpose is to serve Indian graduate students (those already on campus as well as the new incoming ones) and their families at Texas A&M University.
