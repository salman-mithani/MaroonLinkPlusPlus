This includes, but is not limited to, receiving food donations, sorting and shelving food product, operating the front office, participating in marketing events to spread the word about food insecurity,&nbsp;attending&nbsp;social events, and volunteering&nbsp;at other non-profit&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;in the community.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Our members are diverse, coming from a variety of different backgrounds, but we are unified in the spirit of service.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>The 12th Can is affiliated with Brazos Valley Food Bank as a program partner, and we reside under the Student Government Association.
