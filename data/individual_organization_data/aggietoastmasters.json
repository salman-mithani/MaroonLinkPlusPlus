We provide a safe environment for students, faculty, and staff to develop their speaking skills in an enjoyable and engaging fashion. Whether you despise public speaking or take pleasure in it, we supply an open forum and friendly audience to help you practice at your own pace.</p>\r\n<p>Our meetings for the fall of 2018 are currently being held in Rudder 402 at 5:30 PM every Thursday evening.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Frequently Asked Questions:</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>How can I start getting involved?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Just&nbsp;come to a meeting! Being a member is not required to attend and participate in our weekly meetings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why should I become a member?</strong></p>\r\n<p>While you can participate in many ways without being a member, you must be a member to give prepared speeches and run for officer positions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do I become a member?</strong></p>\r\n<p>You must come to a meeting so you can pay membership dues for Toastmasters International through an officer's account. International dues are subjected to the prices on the main base website of Toastmasters. Local dues, which are put toward MSC Open House costs, food for various events, etc., are $15/semester. In addition, there is a $20 fee when creating a Toastmasters International account for the very first time, which pays for the workbooks you will be using throughout your Toastmasters career.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How many speeches do I need to give?</strong></p>\r\n<p>That is entirely up to you. While we encourage members to give speeches as often as they can, you take everything at your own pace.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What will I have to talk about during my speeches?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Whatever you like! While each speech has certain goals associated with it, the content of each speech is entirely up to you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How are meetings structured?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Each meeting is split into three parts:</p>\r\n<p>1. Prepared Speeches - Two or three students sign up for, prepare, and present a speech at the beginning of each meeting. Each speaker is assigned an evaluator who will provide them with specific, positive feedback.</p>\r\n<p>2. Table Topics - One member each week thinks of a series of questions related by a common theme. Members and guests have the opportunity to practice impromptu speaking by briefly answering one of these questions in front of the audience. Don't worry, participatiton&nbsp;is optional!</p>\r\n<p>3. Evaluations - Each evaluator provides the feedback for the speaker they critiqued at the beginning of the meeting. The members acting in the three functionary roles that week then provide everyone who spoke during the meeting with feedback on their allotted time, use of filler words, and general use of grammar.&nbsp;</p>","summary":"As a chapter of Toastmasters International, we strive to help fellow Aggies learn the arts of speaking, listening, and thinking.
