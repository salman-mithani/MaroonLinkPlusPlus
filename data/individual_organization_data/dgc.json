Studies conducted by Tracey and Sedlacek (1985) and Nettles, Theony and Gosman (1986) have found that academic adjustment and achievement of African American and other minority students are influenced by different socio-cultural and contextual factors than those that have an impact on white students.</p>\r\n<p>In light of these factors, NPHC and Department of Greek Life will attempt to address the growing decline in academic achievement, participation in leadership positions and organizations and overall empathy by implementation of a training opportunity. The aim of the club is to introduce young African American men to the complexity of the collegiate male&rsquo;s plight and the infrastructure of the Black Greek-lettered fraternity. This will be accomplished by attendance of eight training seminars and reading of books that best capture the dynamics of the black male image.</p>","summary":"This club focuses not only integration of key concepts of student success, but also components of transitioning.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":false,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1363640,"discussionId":1363640,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":3919,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":null,"TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":null},"profilePicture":null,"organizationType":{"id":3919,"name":"DSA - Dept.
