Each year GHO plans a medical mission trip to provide healthcare to medically underserved communities. We host multiple training sessions for our mission trips, where the upperclassmen medical, dentistry, and nursing students at Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center teach history and physical exam skills to the underclassmen and undergraduate students at TAMU. This provides ample learning and mentoring opportunities that allow all of our members to be prepared for the international medical mission. We also host meetings involving guest speakers with backgrounds in global health. Through the mission trip, training, and meetings, this organization aims to educate and enamor students in the important topic of global health.</p>","summary":"The GHO is a joint organization that includes the College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Dentistry, and undergraduates at Texas A&M University.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2017-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":7824071,"discussionId":7824071,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/tamu_gho/","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":null,"TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":"9f251bb2-b678-49f4-a8b6-f1c6df54c8434cf1a738-efbc-4f8e-bedc-bf9168bd48e5.JPG","organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"4135eac6-9bf4-4212-b804-a77d00012d7b","firstName":"Marienellys","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Delgado-Melendez","primaryEmailAddress":"mdelg09@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":287840,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":"","organizationId":167182,"phoneNumber":"","state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
