The current advisor is Patrick Bolger, a professor in the Psychological and Brain Sciences Department.</p>\r\n<p>As members of Starlight, we strive to serve the community around us. We visit ill children in hospitals, do crafts with them, and play games with them. Throughout the semester, we also make items such as blankets and gift baskets to donate to the kids at the hospitals. We enjoy volunteering in the community as well, with organizations such as Camp for All, Preemie Prints, and Texas Chargers Retreat.</p>\r\n<p>Every fall, we organize a campus-wide donation drive called Helping Harvest. This philanthropy event benefits the local Ronald McDonald House, which keeps families with hospitalized children together and provides resources they need.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Interested in becoming a Starlight Aggie?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The application for membership will be available in Fall 2018!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Important Dates:</strong></p>\r\n<p>MSC Open House -- Sunday, Sept. 2, 1-5 pm</p>\r\n<p>Informationals -- Tuesday, Sept. 4 @ MSC 2502 8:30pm &amp; Wednesday, Sept. 5 @ MSC 2504 8:30pm</p>\r\n<p>APPLICATIONS DUE FRIDAY, SEPT. 7 @ 7PM TO STARLIGHTAGGIES@GMAIL.COM</p>\r\n<p>The Fall 2018 Member Application can be found at this link!&nbsp;<a href=\"https://starlightaggies.wixsite.com/starlightaggies/apply\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://starlightaggies.wixsite.com/starlightaggies/apply</a></p>","summary":"Lifting the spirits of ill children and their families through entertainment, support, and family activities.  \r\n","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":1302751,"discussionId":1302751,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"https://starlightaggies.wixsite.com/starlightaggies","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"https://www.google.com/calendar/b/1/render?tab=mc#main_7%7Cmonth","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/starlightaggies/","LinkedInUrl":"","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Starlight-Aggies/729063340440945","TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":"4a23db53-c4e3-4170-9fd1-17369711c7a34208fa84-3c9b-416c-be8c-0e47bb514883.PNG","organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"1c87355d-6976-4bcb-9af5-a54700f0ef20","firstName":"Marleini","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Ilanga","primaryEmailAddress":"marleiniellette@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":166749,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":89372,"phoneNumber":null,"state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
