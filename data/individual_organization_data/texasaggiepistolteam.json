The Texas Aggie Pistol Team yearly selects its members through open tryouts in the Fall semester. Members of the team train at least once weekly and compete on a national level. We shoot 0.22 LR (5.6x15R mm) caliber target pistols and 0.177 (4.5mm) caliber compressed air pistols. Matches are hosted by Texas A&amp;M once per semester and are attended by various other universities. The Team also travels each year to various matches hosted by competing universities, and each year the Team competes nationally in the Intercollegiate Nationals.</p>\r\n<p>If you're interested in joining us, we hold our Open Shoot at the beginning of each Fall semester which serves as our tryouts. During the tryout you'll get to shoot a modified version of our Standard course of fire. You'll be using one of our target pistols and all safety equipment is provided.&nbsp;No previous experience with firearms is needed. If you'd like to attend our Open Shoot keep us with us on our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tamupistol/?fref=ts\">Facebook</a> page where we will announce when it is being held.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/56l94a4ll2usist/2017%20NRA%20Intercollegiate%20Pistol%20%20Sectional.docx?dl=0\">2017 NRA Intercollegiate Pistol Sectional Match Bulletin</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dN5eYbyTv9irvd0Y5h_E5A3o3ccj52xffOhrifcu6rQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Match Results Database</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=tamupistol%40gmail.com&amp;ctz=America/Chicago\">2016-2017 Schedule</a></strong></p>","summary":"To promote shooting sports and gun safety by participating in intercollegiate pistol competitions, holding open shoots open to those with university affiliation, and supporting pre-college shooting.
