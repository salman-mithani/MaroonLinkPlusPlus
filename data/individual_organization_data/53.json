While each member concentrates on one of these six divisions, the foundation of this team is built upon the importance of group collaboration, leadership development, and self-instruction.</p>","summary":"The Texas A&M University Sounding Rocketry Team is an interdisciplinary student-led organization dedicated to developing member's professional and technical skills by designing, constructing, testing, and launching high-powered hybrid rockets.","status":"Active","comment":null,"showJoin":true,"statusChangeDateTime":null,"startDate":"2014-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","endDate":null,"parentId":85092,"wallId":2366681,"discussionId":2366681,"groupTypeId":null,"organizationTypeId":2756,"cssConfigurationId":null,"deleted":false,"enableGoogleCalendar":false,"modifiedOn":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","socialMedia":{"ExternalWebsite":"https://www.tamusrt.org/","FlickrUrl":"","GoogleCalendarUrl":"","GooglePlusUrl":"","InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/tamusrt/","LinkedInUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/tamusrt/","PinterestUrl":"","TumblrUrl":"","VimeoUrl":"","YoutubeUrl":"","FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/tamusrt/","TwitterUrl":null,"TwitterUserName":""},"profilePicture":"dfbe712d-bfc4-47f6-af64-00c86dcd37b25cb15629-51b0-4d73-8841-e2339da5265c.png","organizationType":{"id":2756,"name":"Registered - Recognized Student Organizations","autoApproveRequests":false,"showMembersToPublic":false,"showOfficersToPublic":true,"eventsEnabled":true,"serviceHoursEnabled":true,"financeEnabled":false,"reRegistrationAvailabilty":null,"electionsEnabled":true,"formsEnabled":true,"galleryEnabled":true,"outcomesEnabled":true,"rosterEnabled":true,"shownInPublicDirectory":true,"documentsEnabled":true,"isSystemType":false,"adminOnly":false},"primaryContact":{"id":"682c8937-62cb-4ef9-b87a-0f7144ddff0c","firstName":"Luis","preferredFirstName":null,"lastName":"Martinez","primaryEmailAddress":"luis.mtz@tamu.edu","profileImageFilePath":null,"institutionId":3557,"privacy":"Unselected"},"isBranch":false,"contactInfo":[{"id":183486,"addressType":0,"city":null,"country":null,"deleted":false,"extension":null,"faxNumber":null,"organizationId":106412,"phoneNumber":null,"state":null,"street1":null,"street2":null,"zip":null}],"legacyKey":null,"parentLegacyKey":null,"legacyPrimaryContactKey":null,"showFacebookWall":false,"showTwitterFeed":false,"submissions":[],"visibility":"Public","isShownInPublicDirectory":true,"isAdminOnly":false,"categories":[]}
