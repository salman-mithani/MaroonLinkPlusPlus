I'm a SkillsUSA 2015 National Champion photographer. I've learned how to create professional results from close to nothing, so don't hesitate to shoot me a question. I primarily shoot Nikon, and I\u00a0currently have a Nikon d3200, a Nikon d5500, a Nikon d800, Fujifilm x100s, and a few film cameras. My special niche in photography is portraiture and fashion.\r\nVP &\u00a0Treasurer - Byron Mitchell\r\nHowdy, My name is Byron Mitchell, and I am a senior Communication student. I began photography in high school using a point and shoot. I finally purchased a medium range dslr (my Canon t5) about a year ago. I don't fancy myself an amazing photographer, but I'm willing to work on myself and help others when possible. If you need anything let me know. I hope you learn a lot in this club.\r\nEvent/Activity Planner - Cooper McCain\r\nHowdy! My name is Cooper McCain, and I\u2019m a senior Industrial Distribution major. I\u2019ve always loved to take photos ever since I was a kid. However, it wasn\u2019t until last January when I got my first camera, a Nikon D5500. Today I shoot with my beloved Nikon D750. I don\u2019t stick to any type of photography, as I pretty much take photos in spontaneous moments when I see something breathtaking, including my girlfriend. Today, I typically find myself taking photos of landscapes, weather, the night sky, and anything else nature related because nature is what I\u2019ve always loved to photograph most.\r\nCreativity Director - Jose Almazan\r\nHowdy! I\u2019m Jose Almazan, and I am a senior University Studies in Architecture major from Laredo, Texas. At first, photography was just an escape from day to day life in high school. However, after a while of immersing myself in the history, books, and videos I began to take it more serious and developed it into a hobby. A few months after graduation I picked up my first DSLR and later my first film camera. Since then I\u2019ve devoted a large portion of my time to learn as much as I can about photography and honing my skills to help others interested in the craft. Currently, I use both digital and film (primarily Sony A7III and Nikon FE) and will shoot anything from Astro to Portraits to Landscapes and Abstracts.\r\nMember Outreach/Historian - Brittany Baysinger\r\nHowdy! My name is Brittany Baysinger, I am a senior Communications & Journalism major. I have been doing photography for 3 years, and I am excited to keep learning along with y\u2019all!

Our club has been instrumental in bringing to Texas A&M community, the Science of holistic Yoga process. Yoga in the western world is typically known as a physical workout leading to flexibility and muscle tone. However Bhakti yoga is the highest and true form of yoga that caters to not just the body but also to mind, intellect and the soul. \u00a0The word 'Bhakti' itself is a word that means 'loving devotional service' and our club is devoted to help students connect with the divine within and experience the true happiness and bliss on a spiritual platform.\r\nWe also invite experienced yogis, traveling monks and distinguished speakers to discuss on various aspects of our existence such as Relationships, Satisfaction, what is happiness, Karma, mind, laws of mind, developing spiritual qualities etc. We hold vegetarian cooking classes especially considering student needs and condition. Our focus is to bring about a transformation, inside-out, and working on the ecology of the heart.\u00a0Thus this holistic process of Bhakti yoga helps not just to integrate your body, mind and soul but also to integrate your existence !\r\nWe \u00a0serve Free vegetarian /vegan food at our all our sessions!!!

Through the continued practice of asanas, you will gain flexibility, strength and derive health benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMantra or Kirtan Yoga: Mantra is a Sanskrit derivation of two words - \"man\", meaning the mind, and \"tra\", meaning deliverance.mantra means delivering the mind. From what you might ask? From the attachments of the mind. Only when the mind is not distracted can one remain steady in the yoga (linking) process.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilosophy of Yoga helps us understand our identity as distinct from the body, mind and intellect. It helps us understand the goal and reason for existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoga of the Soul involves operating from the level of spiritual consciousness. \u00a0The yoga of the soul permeates into activities involving the body, mind and intellect, giving them spiritual substance. More importantly, this process helps develop a feeling ofananda i.e. happiness, contentment or satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoga of Food : This forms a core of the yoga system because it provides appropriate nourishment conducive for the sublime yoga process. A diet that is conducive for the body, mind, intellect and the soul. We conduct veg/vegan cooking classes and serve vegetarian /vegan food at our sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Motto \u00a0: A holistic yoga system would involve considerations of all aspects of existence without discounting any one so that the net effect produced is towards the intended goal of the process. \u00a0So speaking about us, our motto is to help 'Integrate body, mind and soul. Integrate your existence' We are passionate about the integrated approach to the practice of this ancient science of yoga and look forward to sharing it with the Texas A&M community. \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0", "beso": "Bilingual Education Student Organization", "baengsa": "1.)

It\u2019s the right to feel safe no matter what decisions you make for your own body.\r\n\u00b7Complex answer: It\u2019s a social and political movement that combines social justice and reproductive rights. Reproductive Justice aims to provide all people with the economic, social, and political power and resources to make healthy and informed decisions about their own bodies, body expression, sexuality, and reproduction.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat is intersectionality?\r\n\u00b7Simple answer: It\u2019s the idea that all people are connected and no one lives a single-issue life. It\u2019s the idea that we are stronger united.\r\n\u00b7Complex answer: It describe the interconnectedness and overlap of social structures such as class, race, gender and more which perpetuate the systems of discrimination and oppression around the world. Our group takes an intersectional approach to justice, because the only way we can truly make change is to be united. New work in the Reproductive Justice movement is also including post-colonial activism.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat does F.R.E.E.\u00a0do?\r\n\u00b7We are an educational organization that focuses on the intersectionality of reproductive justice through events such as bimonthly meetings, tabling events, condom crawls, and various other activities.\u00a0We also put on events such as\u00a0The Vagina Monologues and\u00a0Out of Silence: Abortion Stories from the 1 in 3 Campaign.\r\n\u00b7We are not a debate club. Any requests for such an event will be declined. We are also not a political organization. We believe that Reproductive Justice should not be a political issue; RJ is a right that anyone should have access to.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat does it mean to be pro-choice?\r\n\u00b7Simple answer: It means that we believe that every person should have the legal and social right and ability to access to the entire spectrum of choices about how to best approach their pregnancy. It also means we believe that the only person who can make the right decision about how to approach their pregnancy is the pregnant individual.\r\n\u00b7Complex answer: It means that we believe that every person should have the legal and social right and ability to access to the entire spectrum of choices about how to best approach their pregnancy.\r\nThis includes the right to access and have complete, unbiased information about all possible choices regarding a pregnancy; possible choices include the right to prenatal care and postnatal care, to continue a pregnancy and become a parent, to end a pregnancy through abortion, to continue a pregnancy and give the child up for adoption, or to choose surrogacy. People should have the right to access medical care if they experience a miscarriage, the post baby blues, postpartum psychosis, etc. We believe that people should not be criminalized for the path they individually choose to take.\r\nOur personal beliefs (our members' beliefs) about abortion, adoption, prenatal care, postnatal care, and surrogacy should only apply to our own lives.\r\nIt is entirely possible to not consider abortion as a possible choice for yourself and to be pro-choice. This is because being pro-choice is believing that the choice of how to approach a pregnancy can only be determined by the individual who is pregnant and anyone who the pregnant individual voluntarily chooses to involve.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat is a Condom Crawl?\u00a0\r\n\u00b7Members and volunteers distribute condoms and Northgate after members of the organization prepare condoms that have been donated to us by The Great American Condom Campaign,\u00a0Planned Parenthood, and Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity (URGE)\u00a0by taping (not stapling) coupons, our contact information, or fun facts to them and putting them in bags.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat are The Vagina Monologues?\r\n\u00b7The Vagina Monologues\u00a0is a play created by Eve Ensler made up of monologues which address taboo topics about vaginas. The topics addressed range from funny topics to more serious topics including lack of consent. This play is not intended to define what a woman is or a what a person with a vagina is. It is simply a play about the personal experiences of different people who have a vagina. (The play has a specific set of monologues.)\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhat is\u00a0Out of Silence: Stories from the 1 in 3 Campaign?\r\n\u00b7The  1 in 3 Campaign is an abortion positive campaign which uses the statistic that 1 in 3 people will have an abortion in their lifetime.\u00a0Out of Silence is a play that showcases some of the thousands of shared abortion stories given to the campaign.

FLARE provides freshmen with the tools and resources to become stronger leaders, both on campus and within the Bryan-College Station community.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOur Purpose:\r\nFLARE aims to create a welcoming environment for freshmen to gain exposure to the College of Liberal Arts, promote unity among liberal arts majors, create unique educational experiences outside of the classroom, promote and support diversity throughout the student body, coordinate events for liberal arts students, and to represent the College of Liberal Arts through community service projects.\r\n How FLARE Works:  FLARE is composed of 3 junior directors, 11-14 sophomore counselors and 50-60 freshmen members. All staff members have been a part of FLARE previously. Our size enables us to create a dynamic environment for freshmen to make a big impact within the Texas A&M community and foster strong friendships within the organization.\u00a0  General meetings are held at 7:00pm every Tuesday night. During this time FLARE comes together to develop as a group. This is usually accomplished by inviting guest speakers who have valuable lessons to offer to our enrichment. Past speakers have included the Dean of Liberal Arts, James Olson from the Bush School, and many professors from the College of Liberal Arts. We also use this time to allow committees to update the organization on their projects and to keep FLARE connected as a whole.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCommittees:\u00a0 Freshmen are placed into one of five committees, each headed by two chairs/counselors. This allows for each member to work on projects that are specific to their interests.\u00a0\r\nThe Public Relations (PR)\u200b committee deals with maintaining FLARE\u2019s image on various social media platforms, designing, ordering, collecting funds, and maintaining communication with manufacturers of FLARE apparel. PR is also responsible for co-planning and co-organizing the Spring Semester all-FLO event.\r\n The Internal Relations (IR) \u200bcommittee works to keep all FLARE members connected by planning and putting on our socials! We also work to build and strengthen friendships between flarians by working with the buddy system and ensuring that everyone feels included. We also collaborate with the directors for Fall and Spring Retreats to showcase our members at the end of each semester.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSpecial Activities and Fundraising\u200b deals with planning and overseeing important events for FLARE, including Parents Night and the Winter Formal, as well as attending to all matters involving raising money for the FLO throughout the year by various means, including organizing profit shares with local restaurants.\r\n The Community Outreach committee (COMOUT)\u200b in FLARE is (as the name implies) the service committee. We coordinate volunteering opportunities for our FLARE members and help our organization improve the university and Bryan/College Station area. Internally we help FLARE members make new connections within FLARE as well as the university as a whole.\r\n The Cultural Inclusion and Academics (CIA)\u200b committee is in charge of providing academic support and cultural exploration for liberal arts students within FLARE. We help students excel in the classroom and the university by bringing faculty, organizations, and other inspirational speakers to discuss opportunities a Liberal Arts degree has. Along with hosting study hours throughout the week, we plan day trips for the purpose of cultural enrichment, including outings to traditional Aggie events.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSocial Activities: For the social aspect of FLARE, each member is placed into a family.\u00a0Families are led by two counselors and are small groups that enable the freshmen to meet others in FLARE outside of their committee. These groups hangout together and do various activities and competitions throughout the semester that enable growth and fun.\u00a0\r\nTons of extra activities are offered throughout the year to give flarians a chance to relax and have fun together. Many socials are put on as well as a Fall and Spring Retreat and a Winter Formal. Groups often go together to movie nights and RenFest or host Girls and Guys nights. We also participate in FLO-Bowl (powderpuff football) and Bump Set FLO (our annual All-FLO Volleyball tournament) and are always open to more activities!\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nFLARE will be hosting informationals:\r\nMonday, Sept. 4th 7pm MSC 2405 Tuesday, Sept. 5th 7pm ANTH 237\r\nCome out and learn about all of the opportunities our student organization has to give!

We propose to be an organization in the service of over 800 Indian graduate students at Texas A&M University.  Our student leaders have recognized that the issues faced by Indian graduate students and their needs are unique to this demographic. These graduate students come from a variety of backgrounds, and face many challenges with transitioning to a distinctly new system of rules and procedures. With a view to addressing these issues, our mission is based on the following key objectives:  1) Advocacy  Many Indian graduate students face serious challenges in coping with the challenges of the university requirements, and on many occasions, they are unaware of the resources available on campus to help resolve their issues. Consequently, there needs to be an organization that can lend a voice to this group of students, and also promote involvement at forums aimed towards university-level policy planning efforts. With these aims in mind, the IGA proposes to work with agencies like the OGS and GSC, among others, to facilitate their efforts with a focused group of the campus community.  2) Networking  There is an urgent need to develop and maintain a strong networking resource that includes members from the current graduate school community, academia, industry professionals and the alumni. It is of utmost importance for the graduate students to be well-informed about the developments pertaining to their experiences at graduate school and beyond. Through events like socials, information sessions and others, IGSA plans to offer a platform for students to develop a strong network base that is both resourceful as well as engaging.   3) Mentoring  A serious lack of mentorship at a departmental level for our graduate students has been observed. Incoming Indian graduate students need guidance to step into the daily routines and workings of the department/courses/research. IGA plans to have departmental points-of-contact for all the major departments and schools on campus who can help the students based on their personal experiences and valuable resources in the form of other similar departmental representatives.

The group was initially brought together by Manuel Chrysaloras, a Greek scholar that taught at the University, in response to physical attack, robbery and harassment of the University's patrons. It was this group that inspired the Ritual and beliefs of modern day Kappa Sigma.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kappa\u00a0Sigma in America was founded one chilly evening in the fall of 1869, as\u00a0five students\u00a0attending the\u00a0University of Virginia\u00a0in\u00a0Charlottesville\u00a0gathered in\u00a0William Grigsby McCormick's room at 46 East Lawn and planted the seed of Brotherhood. For many weeks the bonds of friendship\u00a0had drawn these five together; now the need became clear for a formal structure to contain their feelings. Thus, not only did the Founders formalize their friendship, but they also created a fraternity steeped in the traditions of the past and dedicated to the Pursuit of Learning. The new brothers recorded their bond in a Constitution and in an Oath which set forth.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over time, Kappa Sigma chapters spread across the nation, producing good men with an indelible bond between one another. In 1880, Kappa Sigma established Alpha-Chi Chapter at Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, Illinois. This was the first northern chapter of a fraternity of southern origin. Five years later, expansion into the North began in earnest with Chi Chapter at Purdue University in 1885, and Psi Chapter at the University of Maine in 1886. Expansion to the West started in 1884 with Tau Chapter at the University of Texas and reached the Pacific coast in 1899 with Beta-Zeta Chapter at Stanford University.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In 1924, Kappa Sigma chartered its first Canadian chapter, Delta-Epsilon, at the University of Toronto in Ontario, and became an international Fraternity. With the acquisition in 1966 of\u00a0International Memorial Headquarters\u00a0at Charlottesville, Virginia, near the birthplace of American Kappa Sigma, a new and progressive concept of a professional staff developed. At this point, the Fraternity began experiencing growth that had not been seen since its inception nearly a hundred years prior, and has continued to this day.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Today, Kappa Sigma comprises over 200 chapters and colonies in both the United States and Canada, with over 200,000 men. Kappa Sigma is the sixth largest fraternity and has approximately 150,000 brothers in North America. The list of initiates is not only long, but also distinguished.\u00a0Notable alumni\u00a0are present in every conceivable profession and are making great impressions on the American landscape.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Fraternity now exists now not only as singular chapters, but as an institution that has many mechanisms to support itself and foster growth, coordinated by the hundreds of volunteers nationwide. Every other year (odd years) the Fraternity stages a Grand Conclave for all initiates to come together and celebrate the accomplishments of the Brotherhood. Recent Conclaves have taken place in New Orleans, Pheonix and Memphis; the next one is scheduled for 2003 in Tampa, Florida. At these conventions, as with the regional Leadership Conferences that take place in off years, undergraduates are instructed in basic chapter operations and encouraged to share ideas in order to build a stronger presence at each and every campus where Kappa Sigma is located. These educational programs are funded by the Kappa Sigma Endowment Fund, which also disperses $250,000 in scholarships each year to deserving undergraduates through the the Scholarship/Leadership Program.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is evident from Kappa Sigma's past that the Fraternity is focused on being the top such organization in the nation through building an educated brotherhood of young men with the leadership skills necessary to succeed in all aspects of life.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe future\u00a0looks bright for the Men of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.", "kyx": "KYX exists for several reasons.

Halloran to make initial inquiries and to further grant charters to universities that were accredited and interested in the purpose of The Order of Omega. On February 9, 1967, a Chapter was chartered at the\u00a0University of Southern Mississippi. The Order of Omega voted to become a co-ed organization in the spring of 1977.

Training costs approximately $20,000 \u2013 $30,000; donations and volunteers are crucial.\u00a0All of the money needed to care for the dogs-in-training is donated.\r\nQ: How do I apply for a service dog? \r\nA: Patriot Paws of Aggieland does not directly place service dogs with their veteran partners. To apply for a dog from Patriot Paws, visit patriotpaws.org. Go to the Service Dog tab, click on Application, and download the application form. Follow the instructions to fill it out, and begin the process of regaining your independence!\r\nQ: What is a service animal?\r\nA: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a service animal as any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. Service animals perform some of the functions and tasks that the individual with a disability cannot perform for him or herself. A service animal is a medical device, not a pet. Service animals not only provide a specific service to their handlers, but also greatly enhance the quality of their lives with a new sense of freedom and independence.\r\nThere are three types of Assistance Dogs:\r\n\r\nGuide Dogs: for the blind and the visually impaired\r\nHearing Dogs: for the deaf and the hard of hearing\r\nService Dogs: for people with disabilities other than those related to vision or hearing\r\n\r\nDogs trained by Patriot Paws generally fall under the category of service dogs. Our dogs are trained for mobility assistance, post traumatic stress disorder, and seizure alert/response.\r\nQ: How do I get involved with Patriot Paws of Aggieland?\r\nA: Please visit the 'Get Involved' tab to learn more about how to become a member, puppy sitter, puppy raiser, or officer of PPA. The 'News' tab and our Facebook page provide details about upcoming PPA events.\r\nQ: Can I pet a service dog?\r\nA: Petting is at the handler's discretion. For service dogs in training, socialization is essential - so petting can be helpful, but only with the handler's approval. For working service dogs, petting is often is restricted since it may prevent the dog from doing his/her job correctly. Please do not be offended if a service dog handler does not allow you to pet their dog. Training comes first and foremost. Please do not ever pet a service dog without asking, and please do not call them to you, bark at them, or otherwise distract them! Interfering with or harrassing a service animal is prohibited under the ADA.\r\nQ: Why do your dogs get to go to class/restaurants/stores/etc?\r\nA: Under the ADA (federal law), service animals accompanied by their handlers have public access, but individual state laws regulate access for service dogs in training. Luckily, Texas state law provides service dogs in training with public access when accompanied by their trainer.\r\nTexas Human Resources Code, Chapter 121.003i\r\nAn assistance animal in training shall not be denied admittance to any public facility when accompanied by an approved trainer who is an agent of an organization generally recognized by agencies involved in the rehabilitation of persons who are disabled as reputable and competent to provide training for assistance animals, and/or their handlers.\u00a0\r\nFor more information on Texas law regarding service animals, please visit http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/docs/HR/htm/HR.121.htm\r\nFor more information on the ADA regarding service animals, please visit http://www.ada.gov/qasrvc.htm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "ps": "To bring innovative percussion performance to the university and the surrounding community.

The goal was simply to form a group of motivated students who could work on interesting projects throughout the semester. However, the club soon gained support from other students of various engineering majors who also wished for an opportunity to apply their skills and knowledge.\r\nToday, TURTLE has grown to more than 40 members with several active projects, and it continues to\u00a0be\u00a0the only student organization at Texas A&M University that is specifically geared towards the field of robotics. We hope that the organization will continue to grow and become\u00a0a premier robotics club for the university. Now, the official faculty advisor is  Dr. Pilwon Hur, and many other faculty\u00a0serve as our unofficial\u00a0secondary advisers.\r\nTURTLE's main goal is to provide an opportunity for students to develop and showcase their novel ideas and problem-solving skills. In addition, emphasis\u00a0is placed on team-work and leadership skills.

We own a boat and a selection of slalom, trick, jump skis, and wakeboards so all you have to do is ski!\r\nThe team will travel to\u00a0three to four\u00a0tournaments to compete each semester. When the team travels to tournaments\u00a0club members who are not competing are\u00a0encouraged to travel with the team and compete in B-Team events. We travel all over Texas and Louisiana to attend tournaments for the South Central region.\r\nThe South Central region consists of Louisiana-Monroe, Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana State, Texas, Texas State,\u00a0Texas A&M,\u00a0Baylor and Arkansas.\r\nCollegiate Water Ski tournaments consist of 3 events: Slalom, Trick and Jump. Each event is explained below.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSlalom:\r\nThe general idea in slalom is to ski around a set of balls in the slalom course. The course consists of six turn-balls, a set of gates at each end, and a set of boat guides, which run down the middle.\r\nThe skier must pass in between (not over) the gates at each end, and pass on\u00a0the outside of each turn ball to receive credit for a \"pass\". Each time the course is completed, the boat speed is increased, and the skier is brought back through the course.\r\nOnce the maximum speed is reached, the rope length is decreased: 15' off, 22' off, 28' off, 32' off, 35' off, 38' off, 39 1/2' off, 41' off. \"Off\" refers to the amount of rope removed from a 75' rope (e.g. 15' off is a 60' rope from boat to skier). The skier also has the option to start at any of the available rope lengths. However, the skier does not receive credit for the buoys at that length until he runs a full pass at the highest allowable speed.The skier may choose to start at any speed above his/her minimum allowable speed (24mph female, 26mph male) in two mph increments (e.g. 30, 32, 34 etc). However, the skier must complete the opening pass to receive credit for the speeds below his starting speed. If he falls on his opening pass, he only receives credit for the number of buoys he got around on that pass.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTrick:\r\nTrick, like gymnast on the water, combines cat-like agility with Herculean strength to perform as many different tricks as possible in 20 seconds. Trick skiing is done on a ski that is 40\" to 45\" long and about 10\" wide. The ski has no fins, making spinning and rotation easy, but balance hard. In competition, trick skiing is scored on the tricks that the skier can do within a 20 second period. The tricks are given a pre-assigned point value, and these skier scores are used for skier placement.\r\nWakeboarding can be performed in competition instead of trick skiing but the point values per trick are cut in half due to wakeboarding being less difficult.\r\n\u00a0\r\nJump:\u00a0\r\nJumping is defiantly one of the most exciting of the three events. The thrill of jumping can only be truly understood one way, to do it! Jumping is performed on two wide skis with special sloped, plastic fins. The boat will drive next to the ramp. The skier cuts out and skis over the ramp. The speed at which the jumper hits the ramp and the distance of his or her jump depends on many factors. Speed into the ramp is one of them. Maximum collegiate boat speed for women is 30 mph and 32 mph for men. But the key to distance is the speed the skier travels, not the boat. The harder the skier cuts to the ramp, the more speed is generated, thus making you go farther and higher.\r\nThe Texas A&M Waterski Club is always looking for new members. Whether you are a seasoned pro, a recreational skier, or someone who is interested in simply getting on top of the water; we welcome you!

As this growth continues, so does the need to ensure that animation content represents the world as it should be - a world where women are equally represented, both behind the scenes and on the screen, to move culture forward. Women are known for the ability to value, tap into, and use our creativity and abilities to influence. And women's influence in animation is one that rounds out the industry, grows revenues, and contributes to that forward cultural momentum.
